<h1>R Project Contributors</h1>

<p> The current R is the result of a collaborative effort with
contributions from all over the world.  R was initially written by

R</em>" of the Statistics Department of the University of Auckland.

We have probably omitted some important names here because of
incomplete record keeping.  If we have overlooked you, please let us
know and we'll update the list.  Many more, too numerous to mention
here, have contributed by sending bug reports and suggesting various
improvements.  Simon Davies whilst at the University of Auckland wrote
the original version of glm().  Julian Harris and Wing Kwong (Tiki)
Wan whilst at the University of Auckland assisted Ross Ihaka with the
Macintosh port.

R was inspired by the S environment which has been principally
developed by John Chambers, with substantial input from Douglas Bates,
Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland, Trevor Hastie, Daryl Pregibon and Allan
Wilks.  A special debt is owed to John Chambers who has graciously
contributed advice and encouragement in the early days of R and later
became a member of the core team.
