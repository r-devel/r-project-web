1.  In the article "Sample Size Estimation for Microarray Experiments 
    Using the ssize Package", the term "library" was used incorrectly
    in two places at the start of the "Example" section
    (it has been corrected to "package").

2.  In the same article, directly beneath Figure 3, "52%" has been
    corrected to "60%".

    Thanks to Matthias Kohl for pointing out the error.

3.  In the article "A Multivariate Approach to Integrating Datasets 
    using made4 and ade4", the reference for Jeffrey, Madden, McGettigan
    et al. was incorrect.

    Thanks to Marco Zucchelli for pointing out the error.
