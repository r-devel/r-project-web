1.  The article "BMA: An R package for Bayesian Model Averaging"
    that appeared in R News volume 5(2) contained an error in the second
    paragraph on page 4.  When describing the probability that the variable
    was not in the model, the text gave the value 0.445 when
    in fact the correct value was 0.555.  This error was 
    corrected in the online version of R News 5(2) on 16/12/05.

    Thanks to Antti Pirjeta for pointing out the error.
