  abstract     = {This paper would be a short introduction and overview
                  about the language and environment for statistical
                  analysis R, without entering in specific details too
                  much computational. I give a look about this
                  opensource software pointing out its main features,
                  its functionalities, its pros and cons describing some
                  libraries and the kind of analysis they support. I
                  supply a summary, with a short description, about many
                  resources concerning R that can be found in the Web:
                  the most are in English language, but there are also
                  some in the Italian language. The aim of this work is
                  to contribute in increasing of the use of the R
                  environment in Italy among statistical researchers
                  trying to ``advertise'' this software and its
                  opensource philosophy.},
