                  knowledge about individual statistical tools (survival
                  models, general linear models, etc.), but the art of
                  data analysis is about choosing and using multiple
                  tools. In the words of Chatfield ``...students
                  typically know the technical details of regression for
                  example, but not necessarily when and how to apply
                  it. This argues the need for a better balance in the
                  literature and in statistical teaching between
                  techniques and problem solving strategies.'' Whether
                  analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in
                  observational studies, or developing predictive
                  models, there are common problems that few regression
                  texts address. For example, there are missing data in
                  the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter
                  (other than those used in textbooks!) but most
                  regression texts do not include methods for dealing
                  with such data effectively, and texts on missing data
                  do not cover regression modeling.},

                  modeling by the use of computation using the R

                  of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and
                  two-parameter inferential problems.  Bayesian

                  illustrated in the context of a random effects model.
                  The construction and implementation of Markov Chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced.  These
                  simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a

                  binary response regression, hierarchical modeling,
                  order-restricted inference, and robust modeling.

                  tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the

                  crosses of inbred lines and then in outbred

                  principles of probability and statistics, which are
                  implemented by computational tools based on the R
                  programming language to simulate genetic experiments

  abstract = {This book is very different from any other publication
                  in the field and it is unique because of its focus on
                  the practical implementation of the simulation and
                  estimation methods presented.  The book should be
                  useful to practitioners and students with minimal
                  mathematical background, but because of the many R
                  programs, probably also to many mathematically well
                  educated practitioners.  Many of the methods presented
                  in the book have, so far, not been used much in
                  practice because the lack of an implementation in a
                  unified framework.  This book fills the gap.  With the
                  R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods
                  become easy to use for practitioners and students.  An
                  R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy
                  interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from
                  real life applications.  Although it contains a wide
                  range of results, the book has an introductory
                  character and necessarily does not cover the whole
                  spectrum of simulation and inference for general
                  stochastic differential equations.  The book is
                  organized in four chapters.  The first one introduces
                  the subject and presents several classes of processes
                  used in many fields of mathematics, computational
                  biology, finance and the social sciences.  The second
                  chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers
                  new methods not available in other milestones
                  publication known so far.  The third one is focused on
                  parametric estimation techniques.  In particular, it
                  includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and
                  pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions,
                  generalized method of moments and other techniques.
                  The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like
                  nonparametric estimation, model identification and
                  change point estimation.  The reader non-expert in R
                  language, will find a concise introduction to this
                  environment focused on the subject of the book which
                  should allow for instant use of the proposed material.

                  to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the

                  data visualization system that is sufficient for most
                  everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be
