                  covers a wide range of statistical methodology,
                  including linear and generalized linear models,
                  non-linear and smooth regression, tree-based methods,
                  random and mixed effects, exploratory multivariate
                  analysis, classification, survival analysis, time
                  series analysis, spatial statistics, and
                  optimization. The `on-line complements' available at

  ABSTRACT = {There are many books that are excellent sources of
                  knowledge about individual statistical tools (survival
                  models, general linear models, etc.), but the art of
                  data analysis is about choosing and using multiple
                  tools. In the words of Chatfield ``...students
                  typically know the technical details of regression for
                  example, but not necessarily when and how to apply
                  it. This argues the need for a better balance in the
                  literature and in statistical teaching between
                  techniques and problem solving strategies.'' Whether
                  analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in
                  observational studies, or developing predictive
                  models, there are common problems that few regression
                  texts address. For example, there are missing data in
                  the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter
                  (other than those used in textbooks!) but most
                  regression texts do not include methods for dealing
                  with such data effectively, and texts on missing data
                  do not cover regression modeling.},

                  of discrete bivariate data, nonparametrics, logistic

  ABSTRACT = {With emphasis on the use of R and the interpretation
                  of results rather than the theory behind the methods,
                  this book addresses particular statistical techniques
                  and demonstrates how they can be applied to one or
                  more data sets using R. The authors provide a concise
                  introduction to R, including a summary of its most
                  important features. They cover a variety of topics,
                  such as simple inference, generalized linear models,
                  multilevel models, longitudinal data, cluster
                  analysis, principal components analysis, and
                  discriminant analysis. With numerous figures and
                  exercises, A Handbook of Statistical Analysis using R
                  provides useful information for students as well as
                  statisticians and data analysts.},

  ABSTRACT = {This book surveys the techniques that grow from the
                  regression model, presenting three extensions to that
                  framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed
                  effect models, and nonparametric regression
                  models. The author's treatment is thoroughly modern
                  and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics,
                  generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the
                  use of neural networks in statistics. To demonstrate
                  the interplay of theory and practice, throughout the
                  book the author weaves the use of the R software
                  environment to analyze the data of real examples,
                  providing all of the R commands necessary to reproduce
                  the analyses.},

  ABSTRACT = {This book provides a systematic treatment of robust
                  procedures with an emphasis on practical
                  application. The authors work from underlying
                  mathematical tools to implementation, paying special
                  attention to the computational aspects. They cover the
                  whole range of robust methods, including
                  differentiable statistical functions, distance of
                  measures, influence functions, and asymptotic
                  distributions, in a rigorous yet approachable
                  manner. Highlighting hands- on problem solving, many
                  examples and computational algorithms using the R
                  software supplement the discussion. The book examines
                  the characteristics of robustness, estimators of real
                  parameter, large sample properties, and
                  goodness-of-fit tests. It also includes a brief
                  overview of R in an appendix for those with little
                  experience using the software.},

  ABSTRACT = {This book imparts a thorough understanding of the
                  theory and practical applications of GAMs and related
                  advanced models, enabling informed use of these very
                  flexible tools. The author bases his approach on a
                  framework of penalized regression splines, and builds
                  a well- grounded foundation through motivating
                  chapters on linear and generalized linear
                  models. While firmly focused on the practical aspects
                  of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations
                  of the theory underlying the methods. The treatment is
                  rich with practical examples, and it includes an
                  entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using
                  R and the author's add-on package mgcv. Each chapter
                  includes exercises, for which complete solutions are
                  provided in an appendix.},
