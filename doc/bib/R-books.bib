                  knowledge about individual statistical tools (survival
                  models, general linear models, etc.), but the art of
                  data analysis is about choosing and using multiple
                  tools. In the words of Chatfield ``...students
                  typically know the technical details of regression for
                  example, but not necessarily when and how to apply
                  it. This argues the need for a better balance in the
                  literature and in statistical teaching between
                  techniques and problem solving strategies.'' Whether
                  analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in
                  observational studies, or developing predictive
                  models, there are common problems that few regression
                  texts address. For example, there are missing data in
                  the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter
                  (other than those used in textbooks!) but most
                  regression texts do not include methods for dealing
                  with such data effectively, and texts on missing data
                  do not cover regression modeling.},

                  of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and
                  two-parameter inferential problems.  Bayesian
                  computational methods such as Laplace's method,
                  rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are
                  illustrated in the context of a random effects model.
                  The construction and implementation of Markov Chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced.  These
                  simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a
                  variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and
                  binary response regression, hierarchical modeling,
                  order-restricted inference, and robust modeling.
                  Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian
                  tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the
                  posterior predictive distribution.  The use of R to
                  interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing

  abstract = {This richly illustrated book describes the use of
                  interactive and dynamic graphics as part of
                  multidimensional data analysis.  Chapters include
                  clustering, supervised classification, and working
                  with missing values.  A variety of plots and
                  interaction methods are used in each analysis, often
                  starting with brushing linked low-dimensional views
                  and working up to manual manipulation of tours of
                  several variables.  The role of graphical methods is
                  shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the
                  early exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too,
                  when comparing and evaluating models.},
