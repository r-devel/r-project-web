  abstract = {Instead of presenting the standard theoretical treatments
                  that underlie the various numerical methods used by
                  scientists and engineers, Using R for Numerical
                  Analysis in Science and Engineering shows how to use R
                  and its add-on packages to obtain numerical solutions
                  to the complex mathematical problems commonly faced by
                  scientists and engineers.  This practical guide to the
                  capabilities of R demonstrates Monte Carlo,
                  stochastic, deterministic, and other numerical methods
                  through an abundance of worked examples and code,
                  covering the solution of systems of linear algebraic
                  equations and nonlinear equations as well as ordinary
                  differential equations and partial differential
                  equations.  It not only shows how to use R's powerful
                  graphic tools to construct the types of plots most
                  useful in scientific and engineering work, but also:

                  * Explains how to statistically analyze and fit data
                    to linear and nonlinear models

                  * Explores numerical differentiation, integration, and
                    optimization 

                  * Describes how to find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

                  * Discusses interpolation and curve fitting

                  * Considers the analysis of time serie

                  Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and
                  Engineering provides a solid introduction to the most
                  useful numerical methods for scientific and
                  engineering data analysis using R.}

                  operations.  You'll be able to navigate the R system,
                  enter and import data, manipulate datasets, calculate
                  summary statistics, create statistical plots and
                  customize their appearance, perform hypothesis tests
                  such as the t-tests and analyses of variance, and
                  build regression models. Examples are built around
                  actual datasets to simulate real-world solutions, and
                  programming basics are explained to assist those who
                  do not have a development background. 

                  After reading and using this guide, you'll be
                  comfortable using and applying R to your specific
                  statistical analyses or  hypothesis tests.  No prior
                  knowledge of R or of programming is assumed, though
                  you should have some experience with statistics. 

                  What you'll learn:

                  * How to apply statistical concepts using R and some R
                    programming 

                  * How to work with data files, prepare and manipulate
                    data, and combine and restructure datasets 

                  * How to summarize continuous and categorical variables

                  * What is a probability distribution

                  basics of statistical inference for psychologists,
                  both in a fisherian and a bayesian approach.  Although
                  many authors have recently advocated for the use of
                  bayesian statistics in psychology (Wagenmaker et al.,
                  2010, 2011; Kruschke, 2010; Rouder et al., 2009)
                  statistical manuals for psychologists barely mention
                  them.  This manual provides a full bayesian toolbox
                  for commonly encountered problems in psychology and
                  social sciences, for comparing proportions, variances
                  and means, and discusses the advantages.  But all
                  foundations of the frequentist approach are also
                  provided, from data description to probability and
                  density, through combinatorics and set algebra.  A
                  special emphasis has been put on the analysis of
                  categorical data and contingency tables.  Binomial and
                  multinomial models with beta and Dirichlet priors are
                  presented, and their use for making (between rows or
                  between cells) contrasts in contingency tables is
                  detailed on real data.  An automatic search of the
                  best model for all problem types is implemented in the
                  AtelieR package, available on CRAN.  ANOVA is also
                  presented in a Bayesian flavor (using BIC), and
                  illustrated on real data with the help of the AtelieR
                  and R2STATS packages (a GUI for GLM and GLMM in R).
                  In addition to classical and Bayesian inference on
                  means, direct and Bayesian inference on effect size
                  and standardized effects are presented, in agreement
                  with recent APA recommendations.}

                  academic science and it is rapidly expanding into
                  other fields such as finance.  R is almost limitlessly
                  flexible and powerful, hence its appeal, but can be
                  very difficult for the novice user.  There are no easy
                  pull-down menus, error messages are often cryptic and
                  simple tasks like importing your data or exporting a
                  graph can be difficult and frustrating.  Introductory
                  R is written for the novice user who knows a bit about
                  statistics but who hasn't yet got to grips with the
                  ways of R.  This book: walks you through the basics of
                  R's command line interface; gives a set of simple
                  rules to follow to make sure you import your data
                  properly; introduces the script editor and gives
                  advice on workflow; contains a detailed introduction
                  to drawing graphs in R and gives advice on how to deal
                  with some of the most common errors that you might
                  encounter.  The techniques of statistical analysis in
                  R are illustrated by a series of chapters where
                  experimental and survey data are analysed.  There is a
                  strong emphasis on using real data from real
                  scientific research, with all the problems and
                  uncertainty that implies, rather than well-behaved

  abstract = {Methods of Statistical Model Estimation examines the
                  most important and popular methods used to estimate
                  parameters for statistical models and provide
                  informative model summary statistics. Designed for R
                  users, the book is also ideal for anyone wanting to
                  better understand the algorithms used for statistical
                  model fitting. The text presents algorithms for the
                  estimation of a variety of regression procedures using
                  maximum likelihood estimation, iteratively reweighted
                  least squares regression, the EM algorithm, and MCMC
                  sampling. Fully developed, working R code is
                  constructed for each method. The book starts with OLS
                  regression and generalized linear models, building to
                  two-parameter maximum likelihood models for both
                  pooled and panel models. It then covers a random
                  effects model estimated using the EM algorithm and
                  concludes with a Bayesian Poisson model using
                  Metropolis-Hastings sampling. The book's coverage is
                  innovative in several ways. First, the authors use
                  executable computer code to present and connect the
                  theoretical content. Therefore, code is written for
                  clarity of exposition rather than stability or speed
                  of execution. Second, the book focuses on the
                  performance of statistical estimation and downplays
                  algebraic niceties. In both senses, this book is
                  written for people who wish to fit statistical models
                  and understand them.}

                  and students often lack a thorough understanding of
                  how to apply statistical methods to synthesize
                  biomedical and clinical trial data. Filling this
                  knowledge gap, Applied Meta-Analysis with R shows how
                  to implement statistical meta-analysis methods to real
                  data using R. Drawing on their extensive research and
                  teaching experiences, the authors provide detailed,
                  step-by-step explanations of the implementation of
                  meta-analysis methods using R. Each chapter gives
                  examples of real studies compiled from the
                  literature. After presenting the data and necessary
                  background for understanding the applications, various
                  methods for analyzing meta-data are introduced. The
                  authors then develop analysis code using the
                  appropriate R packages and functions. This systematic
                  approach helps readers thoroughly understand the
                  analysis methods and R implementation, enabling them
                  to use R and the methods to analyze their own
                  meta-data. Suitable as a graduate-level text for a
                  meta-data analysis course, the book is also a valuable
                  reference for practitioners and biostatisticians (even

                  discipline, yet the techniques required to handle them
                  are complicated and often lacking. One of the great
                  ideas in statistical science---multiple
                  imputation---fills gaps in the data with plausible
                  values, the uncertainty of which is coded in the data
                  itself. It also solves other problems, many of which
                  are missing data problems in disguise. Flexible
                  Imputation of Missing Data is supported by many
                  examples using real data taken from the author's vast
                  experience of collaborative research, and presents a
                  practical guide for handling missing data under the
                  framework of multiple imputation. Furthermore,
                  detailed guidance of implementation in R using the
                  author's package MICE is included throughout the
                  book. This graduate-tested book avoids mathematical
                  and technical details as much as possible: formulas
                  are accompanied by a verbal statement that explains
                  the formula in layperson terms. Readers less concerned
                  with the theoretical underpinnings will be able to
                  pick up the general idea, and technical material is
                  available for those who desire deeper
                  understanding. The analyses can be replicated in R
                  using a dedicated package developed by the author.}

                  for data analysis and modelling in recent years, and
                  the BUGS software has become the most popular software
                  for Bayesian analysis worldwide. Authored by the team
                  that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book
                  provides a practical introduction to this program and
                  its use. The text presents complete coverage of all
                  the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction,
                  missing data, model criticism, and prior
                  sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked
                  examples and a wide range of applications from various
                  disciplines. The book introduces regression models,
                  techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide
                  range of modelling issues before going into the vital
                  area of hierarchical models, one of the most common
                  applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with
                  essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in
                  complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model
                  comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative
                  priors, and thoughtful choice of prior
                  distributions---all those aspects of the ``art'' of
                  modelling that are easily overlooked in more
                  theoretical expositions. More pragmatic than
                  ideological, the authors systematically work through
                  the large range of ``tricks'' that reveal the real
                  power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with
                  missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction,
                  ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the
                  examples are biostatistical, but they do not require
                  domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range
                  of other application areas. Full code and data for
                  examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found

                  the book covers key topics, including both discrete
                  and continuous time data, parametric proportional
                  hazards, and accelerated failure times. A much-needed

  abstract = {The last 20 years have seen an increasing interest in
                  the class of joint models for longitudinal and
                  time-to-event data.  These models constitute an
                  attractive paradigm for the analysis of follow-up data
                  that is mainly applicable in two settings: First, when
                  focus is on a survival outcome and we wish to account
                  for the effect of an endogenous time-dependent
                  covariate measured with error, and second, when focus
                  is on the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct
                  for nonrandom dropout.  Aimed at applied researchers
                  and graduate students, this text provides a
                  comprehensive overview of the framework of random
                  effects joint models.  Emphasis is given on
                  applications such that readers will obtain a clear
                  view on the type of research questions that are best
                  answered using a joint modeling approach, the basic
                  features of these models, and how they can be extended
                  in practice.  Special mention is given in checking the
                  assumptions using residual plots, and on dynamic
                  predictions for the survival and longitudinal
                  outcomes.}

  abstract = {R is the amazing, free, open-access software package
                  for scientific graphs and calculations used by
                  scientists worldwide. The R Student Companion is a
                  student-oriented manual describing how to use R in
                  high school and college science and mathematics
                  courses. Written for beginners in scientific
                  computation, the book assumes the reader has just some
                  high school algebra and has no computer programming
                  background. The author presents applications drawn
                  from all sciences and social sciences and includes the
                  most often used features of R in an appendix. In
                  addition, each chapter provides a set of computational
                  challenges: exercises in R calculations that are
                  designed to be performed alone or in groups. Several
                  of the chapters explore algebra concepts that are
                  highly useful in scientific applications, such as
                  quadratic equations, systems of linear equations,
                  trigonometric functions, and exponential
                  functions. Each chapter provides an instructional
                  review of the algebra concept, followed by a hands-on
                  guide to performing calculations and graphing in R. R
                  is intuitive, even fun. Fantastic, publication-quality
                  graphs of data, equations, or both can be produced
                  with little effort. By integrating mathematical
                  computation and scientific illustration early in a
                  student's development, R use can enhance one's
                  understanding of even the most difficult scientific
                  concepts. While R has gained a strong reputation as a
                  package for statistical analysis, The R Student
                  Companion approaches R more completely as a
                  comprehensive tool for scientific computing and
                  graphing.}

                  This book shows how to apply modern resampling
                  techniques to mathematical statistics.  Extensively
                  class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation,
                  Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes
                  the powerful and flexible computer language R to
                  underscore the significance and benefits of modern
                  resampling techniques.  The book begins by introducing
                  permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating
                  classical inference methods.  Striking a balance
                  between theory, computing, and applications, the
                  authors explore additional topics such as: Exploratory
                  data analysis, Calculation of sampling distributions,
                  The Central Limit Theorem, Monte Carlo sampling,
                  Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of
                  estimators, Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests,
                  Regression, Bayesian methods.  Case studies on diverse
                  subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of
                  babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate
                  the relevance of the material.  Mathematical

                  for courses on mathematical statistics at the

                  analysis.  By building knowledge from information,
                  data mining adds considerable value to the ever
                  increasing stores of electronic data that abound
                  today.  In performing data mining many decisions need
                  to be made regarding the choice of methodology, the
                  choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of
                  algorithms.  Throughout this book the reader is
                  introduced to the basic concepts and some of the more
                  popular algorithms of data mining.  With a focus on
                  the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining,
                  Williams guides the reader through various
                  capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source
                  Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated
                  R Statistical Software.  The focus on doing data
                  mining rather than just reading about data mining is
                  refreshing. The book covers data understanding, data
                  preparation, data refinement, model building, model
                  evaluation, and practical deployment.  The reader will
                  learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using
                  software easily installed for free from the Internet.
                  Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated

                  mathematics and hypothetical situations, statistical
                  practice is a translation of a question formulated by
                  a researcher into a series of variables linked by a
                  statistical tool. As with written material, there are
                  almost always differences between the meaning of the
                  original text and translated text. Additionally, many
                  versions can be suggested, each with their advantages
                  and disadvantages. Analysis of Questionnaire Data with
                  R translates certain classic research questions into
                  statistical formulations. As indicated in the title,
                  the syntax of these statistical formulations is based
                  on the well-known R language, chosen for its
                  popularity, simplicity, and power of its
                  structure. Although syntax is vital, understanding the
                  semantics is the real challenge of any good
                  translation. In this book, the semantics of
                  theoretical-to-practical translation emerges
                  progressively from examples and experience, and
                  occasionally from mathematical
                  considerations. Sometimes the interpretation of a
                  result is not clear, and there is no statistical tool
                  really suited to the question at hand. Sometimes data
                  sets contain errors, inconsistencies between answers,
                  or missing data. More often, available statistical
                  tools are not formally appropriate for the given
                  situation, making it difficult to assess to what
                  extent this slight inadequacy affects the
                  interpretation of results. Analysis of Questionnaire
                  Data with R tackles these and other common challenges
                  in the practice of statistics.}

  abstract = {With the advancement of statistical methodology
                  inextricably linked to the use of computers, new
                  methodological ideas must be translated into usable
                  code and then numerically evaluated relative to
                  competing procedures. In response to this, Statistical
                  Computing in C++ and R concentrates on the writing of
                  code rather than the development and study of
                  numerical algorithms per se. The book discusses code
                  development in C++ and R and the use of these
                  symbiotic languages in unison. It emphasizes that each
                  offers distinct features that, when used in tandem,
                  can take code writing beyond what can be obtained from
                  either language alone. The text begins with some
                  basics of object-oriented languages, followed by a
                  ``boot-camp'' on the use of C++ and R. The authors
                  then discuss code development for the solution of
                  specific computational problems that are relevant to
                  statistics including optimization, numerical linear
                  algebra, and random number generation. Later chapters
                  introduce abstract data structures (ADTs) and parallel
                  computing concepts. The appendices cover R and UNIX
                  Shell programming. The translation of a mathematical
                  problem into its computational analog (or analogs) is
                  a skill that must be learned, like any other, by
                  actively solving relevant problems. The text reveals
                  the basic principles of algorithmic thinking essential
                  to the modern statistician as well as the fundamental
                  skill of communicating with a computer through the use
                  of the computer languages C++ and R. The book lays the
                  foundation for original code development in a research
                  environment.}

                  performing a simple statistical analysis. The R Primer

                  solutions to R problems frequently encountered by new
                  users of this statistical software. Rather than
                  explore the many options available for every command
                  as well as the ever-increasing number of packages, the
                  book focuses on the basics of data preparation and
                  analysis and gives examples that can be used as a
                  starting point. The numerous examples illustrate a
                  specific situation, topic, or problem, including data
                  importing, data management, classical statistical
                  analyses, and high-quality graphics production. Each
                  example is self-contained and includes R code that can
                  be run exactly as shown, enabling results from the
                  book to be replicated. While base R is used
                  throughout, other functions or packages are listed if
                  they cover or extend the functionality. After working
                  through the examples found in this text, new users of
                  R will be able to better handle data analysis and
                  graphics applications in R. Additional topics and R

                  presents robust and methodologically sound models for

                  readers to answer increasingly complex research
                  questions. The book applies the principles of modeling
                  to longitudinal data from panel and related studies
                  via the Sabre software package in R. The authors first
                  discuss members of the family of generalized linear
                  models, gradually adding complexity to the modeling
                  framework by incorporating random effects. After
                  reviewing the generalized linear model notation, they
                  illustrate a range of random effects models, including
                  three-level, multivariate, endpoint, event history,
                  and state dependence models. They estimate the
                  multivariate generalized linear mixed models (MGLMMs)
                  using either standard or adaptive Gaussian
                  quadrature. The authors also compare two-level fixed
                  and random effects linear models. The appendices
                  contain additional information on quadrature, model
                  estimation, and endogenous variables, along with
                  SabreR commands and examples. In medical and social
                  science research, MGLMMs help disentangle state
                  dependence from incidental parameters. Focusing on
                  these sophisticated data analysis techniques, this
                  book explains the statistical theory and modeling
                  involved in longitudinal studies. Many examples
                  throughout the text illustrate the analysis of

  abstract = {Statistics and hypothesis testing are routinely used
                  in areas (such as linguistics) that are
                  traditionally not mathematically intensive. In such
                  fields, when faced with experimental data, many
                  students and researchers tend to rely on commercial
                  packages to carry out statistical data analysis,
                  often without understanding the logic of the
                  statistical tests they rely on. As a consequence,
                  results are often misinterpreted, and users have
                  difficulty in flexibly applying techniques relevant
                  to their own research --- they use whatever they
                  happen to have learned. A simple solution is to
                  teach the fundamental ideas of statistical
                  hypothesis testing without using too much
                  mathematics.  This book provides a non-mathematical,
                  simulation-based introduction to basic statistical
                  concepts and encourages readers to try out the
                  simulations themselves using the source code and
                  data provided (the freely available programming
                  language R is used throughout). Since the code
                  presented in the text almost always requires the use
                  of previously introduced programming constructs,
                  diligent students also acquire basic programming
                  abilities in R.  The book is intended for advanced
                  undergraduate and graduate students in any
                  discipline, although the focus is on linguistics,
                  psychology, and cognitive science. It is designed
                  for self-instruction, but it can also be used as a
                  textbook for a first course on statistics. Earlier
                  versions of the book have been used in undergraduate
                  and graduate courses in Europe and the US.},

                  Exploratory Multivariate Analysis by Example Using R
                  focuses on four fundamental methods of multivariate
                  exploratory data analysis that are most suitable for
                  applications. It covers principal component analysis
                  (PCA) when variables are quantitative, correspondence
                  analysis (CA) and multiple correspondence analysis
                  (MCA) when variables are categorical, and hierarchical
                  cluster analysis.  The authors take a geometric point
                  of view that provides a unified vision for exploring
                  multivariate data tables. Within this framework, they
                  present the principles, indicators, and ways of
                  representing and visualizing objects that are common
                  to the exploratory methods. The authors show how to
                  use categorical variables in a PCA context in which
                  variables are quantitative, how to handle more than
                  two categorical variables in a CA context in which
                  there are originally two variables, and how to add
                  quantitative variables in an MCA context in which
                  variables are categorical. They also illustrate the
                  methods and the ways they can be exploited using
                  examples from various fields.  Throughout the text,
                  each result correlates with an R command accessible in
                  the FactoMineR package developed by the authors. All

                  become an essential part of the statistician's
                  toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians
                  with a practical understanding of those methods, and
                  there is no better way to develop intuition and skills
                  for simulation than to use simulation to solve
                  statistical problems.  Introducing Monte Carlo Methods
                  with R covers the main tools used in statistical
                  simulation from a programmer's point of view,
                  explaining the R implementation of each simulation
                  technique and providing the output for better
                  understanding and comparison. While this book
                  constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation
                  methods, the theoretical justification of those
                  methods has been considerably reduced, compared with
                  Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more
                  exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered
                  here.  This book does not require a preliminary
                  exposure to the R programming language or to Monte
                  Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical
                  background. While many examples are set within a
                  Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian
                  statistics is not required. The book covers basic
                  random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques
                  for integration and optimization, convergence
                  diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including
                  Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive
                  algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R
                  programs are available as an R package called
                  mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical
                  interest in simulation methods but no previous
                  exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and
                  practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal
                  processing, communications engineering, control
                  theory, econometrics, finance and more. The

                  biostatistical methods for analyzing the data are then
                  identified. The authors develop analysis code step by
                  step using appropriate R packages and functions. This
                  approach enables readers to gain an understanding of
                  the analysis methods and R implementation so that they
                  can use R to analyze their own clinical trial
                  data. With step-by-step illustrations of R
                  implementations, this book shows how to easily use R
                  to simulate and analyze data from a clinical trial. It
                  describes numerous up-to-date statistical methods and
                  offers sound guidance on the processes involved in
                  clinical trials.}

  abstract = { Spatial statistics are useful in subjects as diverse
                  as climatology, ecology, economics, environmental and
                  earth sciences, epidemiology, image analysis and
                  more. This book covers the best-known spatial models
                  for three types of spatial data: geostatistical data
                  (stationarity, intrinsic models, variograms, spatial
                  regression and space-time models), areal data
                  (Gibbs-Markov fields and spatial auto-regression) and
                  point pattern data (Poisson, Cox, Gibbs and Markov
                  point processes). The level is relatively advanced,
                  and the presentation concise but complete. The most
                  important statistical methods and their asymptotic
                  properties are described, including estimation in
                  geostatistics, autocorrelation and second-order
                  statistics, maximum likelihood methods, approximate
                  inference using the pseudo-likelihood or Monte-Carlo
                  simulations, statistics for point processes and
                  Bayesian hierarchical models. A chapter is devoted to
                  Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (Gibbs sampler,
                  Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and exact simulation).
                  A large number of real examples are studied with R,
                  and each chapter ends with a set of theoretical and
                  applied exercises. While a foundation in probability
                  and mathematical statistics is assumed, three
                  appendices introduce some necessary background. The
                  book is accessible to senior undergraduate students
                  with a solid math background and Ph.D. students in
                  statistics. Furthermore, experienced statisticians and
                  researchers in the above-mentioned fields will find
                  the book valuable as a mathematically sound
                  reference. This book is the English translation of

                  down-to-earth forestry data analysis and solutions to

                  state-of-the-art statistical and data-handling
                  functionality. The authors adopt a problem-driven
                  approach, in which statistical and mathematical tools
                  are introduced in the context of the forestry problem
                  that they can help to resolve. All the tools are
                  introduced in the context of real forestry datasets,
                  which provide compelling examples of practical
                  applications.  The modeling challenges covered within
                  the book include imputation and interpolation for
                  spatial data, fitting probability density functions to
                  tree measurement data using maximum likelihood,
                  fitting allometric functions using both linear and
                  non-linear least-squares regression, and fitting
                  growth models using both linear and non-linear
                  mixed-effects modeling. The coverage also includes
                  deploying and using forest growth models written in
                  compiled languages, analysis of natural resources and
                  forestry inventory data, and forest estate planning
                  and optimization using linear programming.  The book
                  would be ideal for a one-semester class in forest
                  biometrics or applied statistics for natural resources
                  management. The text assumes no programming

                  to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics
                  presents simple yet thorough explanations of the most
                  important multivariate statistical methods for
                  analyzing chemical data.  It includes discussions of
                  various statistical methods, such as principal
                  component analysis, regression analysis,
                  classification methods, and clustering.  Written by a
                  chemometrician and a statistician, the book reflects
                  both the practical approach of chemometrics and the
                  more formally oriented one of statistics.  To enable a
                  better understanding of the statistical methods, the
                  authors apply them to real data examples from
                  chemistry.  They also examine results of the different
                  methods, comparing traditional approaches with their
                  robust counterparts.  In addition, the authors use the
                  freely available R package to implement methods,
                  encouraging readers to go through the examples and
                  adapt the procedures to their own problems.  Focusing
                  on the practicality of the methods and the validity of
                  the results, this book offers concise mathematical
                  descriptions of many multivariate methods and employs
                  graphical schemes to visualize key concepts.  It
                  effectively imparts a basic understanding of how to

                  data.}

                  modeling by the use of computation using the R
                  language. T he early chapters present the basic tenets
                  of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and
                  two-parameter inferential problems.  Bayesian
                  computational methods such as Laplace's method,
                  rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are
                  illustrated in the context of a random effects model.
                  The construction and implementation of Markov Chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced.  These
                  simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a
                  variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and
                  binary response regression, hierarchical modeling,
                  order-restricted inference, and robust modeling.
                  Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian
                  tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the
                  posterior predictive distribution.  The use of R to
                  interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing
                  language, is described with several illustrative
                  examples.  The second edition contains several new
                  topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors
                  and the use of Zellner's g priors to choose between
                  models in linear regression.  There are more
                  illustrations of the construction of informative prior
                  distributions, such as the use of conditional means
                  priors and multivariate normal priors in binary
                  regressions.  The new edition contains changes in the
                  R code illustrations according to the latest edition

  abstract = {This book provides insight and practical illustrations
                  on how modern statistical concepts and regression
                  methods can be applied in medical prediction problems,
                  including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes.  Many
                  advances have been made in statistical approaches
                  towards outcome prediction, but these innovations are
                  insufficiently applied in medical research.
                  Old-fashioned, data hungry methods are often used in
                  data sets of limited size, validation of predictions
                  is not done or done simplistically, and updating of
                  previously developed models is not considered.  A
                  sensible strategy is needed for model development,
                  validation, and updating, such that prediction models
                  can better support medical practice.  Clinical
                  prediction models presents a practical checklist with
                  seven steps that need to be considered for development
                  of a valid prediction model. These include preliminary
                  considerations such as dealing with missing values;
                  coding of predictors; selection of main effects and
                  interactions for a multivariable model; estimation of
                  model parameters with shrinkage methods and
                  incorporation of external data; evaluation of
                  performance and usefulness; internal validation; and
                  presentation formats.  The steps are illustrated with
                  many small case-studies and R code, with data sets
                  made available in the public domain.  The book further
                  focuses on generalizability of prediction models,
                  including patterns of invalidity that may be
                  encountered in new settings, approaches to updating of
                  a model, and comparisons of centers after case-mix
                  adjustment by a prediction model.  The text is
                  primarily intended for clinical epidemiologists and
                  biostatisticians.  It can be used as a textbook for a
                  graduate course on predictive modeling in diagnosis
                  and prognosis.  It is beneficial if readers are
                  familiar with common statistical models in medicine:
                  linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox
                  regression.  The book is practical in nature.  But it
                  provides a philosophical perspective on data analysis
                  in medicine that goes beyond predictive modeling.  In
                  this era of evidence-based medicine, randomized
                  clinical trials are the basis for assessment of
                  treatment efficacy.  Prediction models are key to
                  individualizing diagnostic and treatment decision
                  making.},

                  comparisons of different approaches to the same

                  the practical implementation of the simulation and
                  estimation methods presented.  The book should be
                  useful to practitioners and students with minimal
                  mathematical background, but because of the many R
                  programs, probably also to many mathematically well
                  educated practitioners.  Many of the methods presented

                  practice because the lack of an implementation in a
                  unified framework.  This book fills the gap.  With the
                  R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods
                  become easy to use for practitioners and students.  An

                  stochastic differential equations.  The book is

                  used in many fields of mathematics, computational
                  biology, finance and the social sciences.  The second
                  chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers
                  new methods not available in other milestones
                  publication known so far.  The third one is focused on
                  parametric estimation techniques.  In particular, it
                  includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and
                  pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions,
                  generalized method of moments and other techniques.
                  The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like
                  nonparametric estimation, model identification and
                  change point estimation.  The reader non-expert in R

                  the next step is to address each of these

                  valid models.  The regression output and plots that

  abstract = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R is divided into
                  two basic parts, the first presenting R packages,
                  functions, classes and methods for handling spatial
                  data.  This part is of interest to users who need to
                  access and visualise spatial data.  Data import and
                  export for many file formats for spatial data are
                  covered in detail, as is the interface between R and
                  the open source GRASS GIS. The second part showcases
                  more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis,
                  including spatial point pattern analysis,
                  interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis
                  and disease mapping.  The coverage of methods of
                  spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques
                  to new developments, and the examples used are largely
                  taken from the spatial statistics literature.  All the
                  examples can be run using R contributed packages
                  available from the CRAN website, with code and
                  additional data sets from the book's own website.
                  This book will be of interest to researchers who
                  intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse
                  spatial data.  It will also be of interest to spatial
                  data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested
                  in practical aspects of implementing software for
                  spatial data analysis.  It is a suitable companion
                  book for introductory spatial statistics courses and
                  for applied methods courses in a wide range of
                  subjects using spatial data, including human and
                  physical geography, geographical information systems,
                  the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and
                  disease control, economics, public administration and
                  political science.  The book has a website where
                  coloured figures, complete code examples, data sets,

                  this area are applicable to a wide array of problems
                  in environmental epidemiology.  This book provides an
                  overview of the methods used for investigating the
                  health effects of air pollution and gives examples and
                  case studies in R which demonstrate the application of
                  those methods to real data.  The book will be useful
                  to statisticians, epidemiologists, and graduate
                  students working in the area of air pollution and
                  health and others analyzing similar data.  The authors
                  describe the different existing approaches to
                  statistical modeling and cover basic aspects of
                  analyzing and understanding air pollution and health
                  data.  The case studies in each chapter demonstrate
                  how to use R to apply and interpret different
                  statistical models and to explore the effects of
                  potential confounding factors.  A working knowledge of
                  R and regression modeling is assumed.  In-depth
                  knowledge of R programming is not required to
                  understand and run the examples.  Researchers in this
                  area will find the book useful as a ``live''
                  reference.  Software for all of the analyses in the
                  book is downloadable from the web and is available
                  under a Free Software license.  The reader is free to
                  run the examples in the book and modify the code to
                  suit their needs.  In addition to providing the
                  software for developing the statistical models, the
                  authors provide the entire database from the National
                  Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS)
                  in a convenient R package.  With the database, readers

  abstract = {Since its inception, R has become one of the
                  preeminent programs for statistical computing and data
                  analysis.  The ready availability of the program,
                  along with a wide variety of packages and the
                  supportive R community make R an excellent choice for
                  almost any kind of computing task related to
                  statistics.  However, many users, especially those
                  with experience in other languages, do not take
                  advantage of the full power of R.  Because of the
                  nature of R, solutions that make sense in other
                  languages may not be very efficient in R.  This book
                  presents a wide array of methods applicable for
                  reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that
                  data.  In addition to the built-in functions, a number
                  of readily available packages from CRAN (the
                  Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered.
                  All of the methods presented take advantage of the
                  core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of
                  subscripting, and the proper use of the varied
                  functions in R that are provided for common data
                  management tasks.  Most experienced R users discover
                  that, especially when working with large data sets, it
                  may be helpful to use other programs, notably
                  databases, in conjunction with R.  Accordingly, the
                  use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with
                  methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and
                  datasets created by other programs.  Character
                  manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is
                  also covered in detail, allowing problems that are
                  traditionally solved by scripting languages to be
                  carried out entirely within R.  For users with
                  experience in other languages, guidelines for the
                  effective use of programming constructs like loops are
                  provided.  Since many statistical modeling and
                  graphics functions need their data presented in a data
                  frame, techniques for converting the output of
                  commonly used functions to data frames are provided
                  throughout the book.  Using a variety of examples
                  based on data sets included with R, along with easily
                  simulated data sets, the book is recommended to anyone
                  using R who wishes to advance from simple examples to
                  practical real-life data manipulation solutions.},

                  providing an accessible introduction to the subject,
                  filled with examples drawn from the social and
                  political sciences.  Readers are introduced to the
                  principles of nonparametric smoothing and to a wide
                  variety of smoothing methods.  The author also explains
                  how smoothing methods can be incorporated into
                  parametric linear and generalized linear models.  The
                  use of smoothers with these standard statistical
                  models allows the estimation of more flexible
                  functional forms whilst retaining the interpretability
                  of parametric models.  The full potential of these
                  techniques is highlighted via the use of detailed
                  empirical examples drawn from the social and political
                  sciences.  Each chapter features exercises to aid in

                  is its integration with the R computing environment.
                  The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by
                  the R commands used to produce them.  An extensive R
                  package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R
                  functions and all of the data used in the book,
                  accompanies the written text.  Script files of R
                  commands for each chapter are available for download.
                  There is also an extensive appendix in the book that
                  leads the reader through the use of R commands and the
                  new R package to carry out the analyses.},

  isbn = {978-0-387-75960-9},
  publisherurl = {http://www.springer.com/978-0-387-75960-9},
  abstract = {Wavelet methods have recently undergone a rapid period
                  of development with important implications for a
                  number of disciplines including statistics.  This book
                  fulfils three purposes.  First, it is a gentle
                  introduction to wavelets and their uses in statistics.
                  Second, it acts as a quick and broad reference to many
                  recent developments in the area.  The book
                  concentrates on describing the essential elements and
                  provides comprehensive source material references.
                  Third, the book intersperses R code that explains and
                  demonstrates both wavelet and statistical methods.
                  The code permits the user to learn the methods, to
                  carry out their own analyses and further develop their
                  own methods.  The book is designed to be read in
                  conjunction with WaveThresh4, the freeware R package
                  for wavelets.  The book introduces the wavelet
                  transform by starting with the simple Haar wavelet
                  transform and then builds to consider more general
                  wavelets such as the Daubechies compactly supported
                  series.  The book then describes the evolution of
                  wavelets in the directions of complex-valued wavelets,
                  non-decimated transforms, multiple wavelets and
                  wavelet packets as well as giving consideration to
                  boundary conditions initialization.  Later chapters
                  explain the role of wavelets in nonparametric
                  regression problems via a variety of techniques
                  including thresholding, cross-validation, SURE,
                  false-discovery rate and recent Bayesian methods, and
                  also consider how to deal with correlated and
                  non-Gaussian noise structures.  The book also looks at
                  how nondecimated and packet transforms can improve
                  performance.  The penultimate chapter considers the
                  role of wavelets in both stationary and non-stationary
                  time series analysis.  The final chapter describes
                  recent work concerning the role of wavelets for
                  variance stabilization for non-Gaussian intensity
                  estimation.  The book is aimed at final year
                  undergraduate and Masters students in a numerate
                  discipline (such as mathematics, statistics, physics,
                  economics and engineering) and would also suit as a
                  quick reference for postgraduate or research level
                  activity.  The book would be ideal for a researcher to
                  learn about wavelets, to learn how to use wavelet
                  software and then to adapt the ideas for their own
                  purposes.},

                  sciences are written at a level that a
                  non-statistician will easily understand.  This is a
                  book written in colloquial language, avoiding
                  mathematical formulae as much as possible, trying to
                  explain statistical methods using examples and
                  graphics instead. To use the book efficiently, readers
                  should have some computer experience. The book starts
                  with the simplest of statistical concepts and carries
                  readers forward to a deeper and more extensive
                  understanding of the use of statistics in
                  environmental sciences.  The book concerns the
                  application of statistical and other computer methods
                  to the management, analysis and display of spatial
                  data.  These data are characterised by including
                  locations (geographic coordinates), which leads to the
                  necessity of using maps to display the data and the
                  results of the statistical methods. Although the book
                  uses examples from applied geochemistry, and a large
                  geochemical survey in particular, the principles and
                  ideas equally well apply to other natural sciences,
                  e.g., environmental sciences, pedology, hydrology,
                  geography, forestry, ecology, and health
                  sciences/epidemiology.  The book is unique because it
                  supplies direct access to software solutions (based on
                  R, the Open Source version of the S-language for
                  statistics) for applied environmental statistics. For
                  all graphics and tables presented in the book, the
                  R-scripts are provided in the form of executable
                  R-scripts.  In addition, a graphical user interface
                  for R, called DAS+R, was developed for convenient,
                  fast and interactive data analysis.  Statistical Data
                  Analysis Explained: Applied Environmental Statistics
                  with R provides, on an accompanying website, the

  abstract = {Quantifying shape and size variation is essential in
                  evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines.
                  Since the ``morphometric revolution of the 90s,'' an
                  increasing number of publications in applied and
                  theoretical morphometrics emerged in the new
                  discipline of statistical shape analysis.  The R
                  language and environment offers a single platform to
                  perform a multitude of analyses from the acquisition
                  of data to the production of static and interactive
                  graphs.  This offers an ideal environment to analyze
                  shape variation and shape change.  This open-source
                  language is accessible for novices and for experienced
                  users.  Adopting R gives the user and developer
                  several advantages for performing morphometrics:
                  evolvability, adaptability, interactivity, a single
                  and comprehensive platform, possibility of interfacing
                  with other languages and software, custom analyses,
                  and graphs.  The book explains how to use R for
                  morphometrics and provides a series of examples of
                  codes and displays covering approaches ranging from
                  traditional morphometrics to modern statistical shape
                  analysis such as the analysis of landmark data, Thin
                  Plate Splines, and Fourier analysis of outlines.  The
                  book fills two gaps: the gap between theoreticians and
                  students by providing worked examples from the
                  acquisition of data to analyses and hypothesis
                  testing, and the gap between user and developers by
                  providing and explaining codes for performing all the
                  steps necessary for morphometrics rather than
                  providing a manual for a given software or package.
                  Students and scientists interested in shape analysis
                  can use the book as a reference for performing applied
                  morphometrics, while prospective researchers will
                  learn how to implement algorithms or interfacing R for
                  new methods.  In addition, adopting the R philosophy
                  will enhance exchanges within and outside the
                  morphometrics community.  Julien Claude is
                  evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist at the
                  University of Montpellier 2 where he got his Ph.D. in
                  2003.  He works on biodiversity and phenotypic

                  guide to R for users with a background in economics or
                  the social sciences. Readers are assumed to have a
                  background in basic statistics and econometrics at the
                  undergraduate level. A large number of examples should

                  and backed up by discussed real datasets available

                  methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather
                  than focusing on its theoretical justifications.
                  Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior
                  distributions in each case and specific reference
                  solutions are given for each of the models.
                  Similarly, computational details are worked out to
                  lead the reader towards an effective programming of
                  the methods given in the book.  While R programs are
                  provided on the book website and R hints are given in

                  example, but not necessarily when and how to apply it.

                  techniques and problem solving strategies.'' Whether
                  analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in
                  observational studies, or developing predictive
                  models, there are common problems that few regression
                  texts address.  For example, there are missing data in

                  with such data effectively, and texts on missing data
