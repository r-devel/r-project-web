                  data analysis using R or S-Plus. In the first chapters
                  it gives an introduction to the S language. Then it
                  covers a wide range of statistical methodology,
                  including linear and generalized linear models,
                  non-linear and smooth regression, tree-based methods,
                  random and mixed effects, exploratory multivariate
                  analysis, classification, survival analysis, time
                  series analysis, spatial statistics, and
                  optimization. The `on-line complements' available at
                  the books homepage provide updates of the book, as
                  well as further details of technical material. }

  URL = {http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/RmS},
  ABSTRACT = {There are many books that are excellent sources of
                  knowledge about individual statistical tools
                  (survival models, general linear models, etc.), but
                  the art of data analysis is about choosing and using
                  multiple tools. In the words of Chatfield
                  ``...students typically know the technical details of
                  regression for example, but not necessarily when and
                  how to apply it. This argues the need for a better
                  balance in the literature and in statistical
                  teaching between techniques and problem solving
                  strategies.'' Whether analyzing risk factors,
                  adjusting for biases in observational studies, or
                  developing predictive models, there are common
                  problems that few regression texts address. For
                  example, there are missing data in the majority of
                  datasets one is likely to encounter (other than
                  those used in textbooks!) but most regression texts
                  do not include methods for dealing with such data
                  effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover
                  regression modeling.}

                  design, and relation between graphs and traditional
                  tabular results. Can serve as a graduate-level
                  standalone statistics text and as a reference book for
                  researchers. In-depth discussions of regression
                  analysis, analysis of variance, and design of
                  experiments are followed by introductions to analysis
                  of discrete bivariate data, nonparametrics, logistic
                  regression, and ARIMA time series modeling. Concepts
                  and techniques are illustrated with a variety of case

                  focusing on learning the underlying theory. It
                  includes a large collection of exercises and numerous
                  practical examples from a broad range of scientific
                  disciplines. It comes complete with an online resource
                  containing datasets, R functions, selected solutions
                  to exercises, and updates to the latest features. A
                  full solutions manual is available from Chapman \&
