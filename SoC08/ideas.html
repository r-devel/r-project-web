<h2>Roxygen</h2>
	  
<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~eugster/">Manuel
J. A. Eugster</a></p>

<p><tt>Roxygen</tt> is an extension of the <tt>R</tt> language and
provides a documentation and development assistance system. The
documentation system is in the style of <a
href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>
or <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a>, and
the development assitance system is (somehow) like a
pre-processor with its directives.</p>

<p><a href="Roxygen.pdf">Full Outline (pdf)</a></p>

<p><b>Project attributes:</b> Sophisticated project; student needs
to know <tt>R</tt> very well, especially the structural elements
like functions, S3/4 classes, generics, ..., and the student needs
some basic knowledge about writing a parser. At best, the student
has worked with Doxygen, Javadoc or another documentation
system.</p>

<h2>Ruml</h2>

<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~eugster/">Manuel
J. A. Eugster</a></p>

<p><tt>Ruml</tt> creates UML class diagrams from existing S classes
in the sense of <a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/">UMLGraph</a>
for Java classes. This is usefull for documentation and
exploration of existing packages: <tt>R</tt> specific things like
generic functions, namespaces, S3 and S4, ... should be
considered.</p>

<p><a href="Ruml.pdf">Full Outline (pdf)</a></p>

<p><b>Project attributes:</b> Easier project; student needs to
know the structual elements of <tt>R</tt> (like functions, S3/4
classes, generics, ...,) very well and has basic knowlegde about
UML (class diagrams).

<h2>Connecting R and PostgreSQL using DBI</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a>

<p>
<b>Summary:</b> R has a the widely used database-abstraction interface
   'DBI' with support for MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, ... backends.
   Support for PostgreSQL would complement this.

<p>
<b>Required skills:</b> Knowledge of C programming is required; knowledge of
   R and SQL are beneficial.

<p> <b>Description:</b> The 'Database Interface' (DBI) package provides
an abstraction layer between R and the actual database backend.  This
requires 'glue code' for every given backend to provide the support
for the API exposed by DBI. R has DBI support for MySQL, SQLite and
Oracle backends, but not for PostgreSQL.  However, there is an
alternate interface package Rdbi with a matching RdbiPgSQL backend. It
appears that Rdbi has stalled in the sense that no other backend was
ever provided.  .  This SummerOfCode project consists of taking what
is already available via Rdbi as bringing it to the more widely-used
DBI framework.

<h2>cran2deb: Generate Debian Packages for R from Package Sources</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a>

<p> <b>Summary:</b> GNU R has become the preeminent platform for
'computing with data'. The CRAN archives contain over 1300 source
packages of very high-quality, and BioConductor has another 200+. We
want more of these in Debian, and going beyond the 50+ packages we
currently have suggests more scripting and automation.


<p>
<b>Required skills:</b>
Familiarity with R, preferably actual programming experience;
alternatively programming experience in another scripting
language (Perl, Python, ...). Some familiarity with Debian
package building, C++ knowledge may be beneficial to
connect to apt's data structures. Basic SQL knowledge may
be helpful for the meta-data collection.

<p> <b>Description:</b> CRAN packages have in almost all cases
licenses which are suitable for Debian 'main'. Moreover, the internal
packaging and structure of these packages already resembles some of
the Debian meta-data, and the build process itself is
standardised. What is needed are a set of tools to collect package
meta-data (and the <a
href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/index.html" target="_top">CRANberries</a>
aggregator has one-half, apt has the other), 'map' the meta-data and
then script package fragments. While the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/AliothPkgBioc" target="_top">PkgBioc</a> project on
Alioth has done work in this area, it may be worthwhile to try a new
and simpler approach.

<h2>crantastic.org: Build a Community Site for R</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://had.co.nz">Hadley Wickham</a>

<p> <b>Summary:</b> Create an information portal for the fast growing
list of R packages, integrating package documentation and journal
publications with feedback from the useR community.

<p>
<b>Required skills:</b>
Familiarity with Ruby and R, and web development in general (html,
css, js, ...). knowledge of RSS/Atom could be useful.


<p> <b>Description:</b> The CRAN archives contain over 1300 source
packages of very high-quality, and BioConductor has another 200+. For
many data analytic tasks there is more than one package offering a
solution, often using different names for similar functionality,
because different research communities may use different vocabulary
for similar methods (e.g., statistics vs. machine learning
jargon). Hence it is often hard for users to find the packages they
really need. CRAN <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/" >task
views</a> offer some help, but are edited by designated maintainers
and hence cannot cover all fields and aspects.

<p>
<a href="http://crantastic.org" >crantastic.org</a> implements a first
step in complementing this with package reviews from the useR
community, but it still lacks many features we would like to have:
integration with task views, vignettes, and journal publications;
match authors and users based on email address; list top users and
authors on respective pages; implement a rating system; event streams
for packages and users; integration with <a
href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/index.rss" >CRANberries
RSS feed</a>, etc.

<h2>Finite Mixture Models for Large Data Sets</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/">Friedrich Leisch</a>

<p> <b>Summary:</b> Transfer the most popular mixture models in R
package <a href="http://cran.R-project.org/package=flexmix">flexmix</a> from
interpreted R code to compiled C code, add interactive visualization
to the package.

<p>
<b>Required skills:</b>
Familiarity with R, preferably actual programming experience. C programming. 

<p> <b>Description:</b> Finite mixture models are the current
state-of-the-art in marketing research to cluster consumers into market
segments. Package <a href="http://cran.R-project.org/package=flexmix">
flexmix</a> implements a flexible framework for fitting this type of
models, and is mainly designed for rapid prototyping. As all code is
currently interpreted R code, the fitting is rather slow for large
data sets. In order to use the package for mining large data sets, the
most poular models in the package should be re-implemented in C. In
addition, there are ideas on interactive visualization of these models
using R packages like
<a href="http://cran.R-project.org/package=rggobi">rggobi</a> or 
<a href="http://cran.R-project.org/package=iplots">iplots</a>.

<h2>XML format and tools for R documentation</h2>
<b>Mentor</b>
<a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan">Duncan Temple Lang</a>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
Extend an experimental R package that provides a collection of tools
for working with documentation for R functions, classes, data and
dynamic documents using XML as the format.

<p>
<b>Required skills</b>
Programming experience with R and some knowledge of S4 classes,
knowledge of XML and XSL.

<p> <b>Description</b> The Rd format used for R functions has served
us well for quite some time, but a richer format that could handle,
e.g. plots, images, annotated examples, allow includes of
sub-documents to allow for reuse across documents, easier validation,
user-level extensions would be valuable. Some initial work has been
done to define a format for documenting R functions, classes, methods
and data via an XML format, leveraging DocBook.  Along with this, we
need tools to both generate the template documents that authors
complete and then process them.  This involves updating them
programmatically from within R, e.g. to validate and update the list
of parameters in a function or slots in a class.  Also, we need tools
to transform the XML documents to different formats such as PDF, HTML,
Rd, LaTeX and simple text which is done primarily through XSL.  A
prototype for some of this is already in place, but there is a need to
extend and complete it and also explore new ideas so there is
significant room for creativity and initiative.  And this dovetails
into a project for authoring more general documents using a
reproducible, dynamic mechanism based on XML.

<h2>Embedding R in Gnumeric</h2>
<b>Mentor</b>
<a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan">Duncan Temple Lang</a>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
Develop a new plugin for the Gnumeric spreadsheet which allows
R functions and graphics to be used directly from Gnumeric.

<p>
<b>Required skills</b>
Programming experience with R and C and an understanding of the
computational model of spreadsheets.

<p> <b>Description</b> This involves a new implementation of the ideas
from a previous R-Gnumeric plugin (<a
href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGnumeric">RGnumeric</a>) and extension
of the ideas in that initial implementation.  The aim is to allow R
functions to be accessed as if they were built-in Gnumeric functions
for use in spreadsheets.  Also, we want to be able to use the R
graphics engine to create plots that can be placed on sheets similar
to the existing Gnumeric charting facilities.  A further wrinkle is to
be able to programmatically augment the Gnumeric GUI from within R
using RGtk2.  These facilities will allow users access to many of R's
facilities from within a convenient interface and be useful in business
and education.

<h2>Embedding Mozilla in R</h2>
<b>Mentor</b>
<a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan">Duncan Temple Lang</a>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
Make the Mozilla HTML renderer available as a component in R
so that we can display HTML documents with events and actions
processed in R. An alternative is to make R a plugin for Firefox.

<p>
<b>Required skills</b>
Programming experience with R and C++ and an understanding of the
computational model of spreadsheets.
