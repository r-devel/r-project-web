<h2>Roxygen</h2>
	  
<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~eugster/">Manuel
J. A. Eugster</a></p>

<p><tt>Roxygen</tt> is an extension of the <tt>R</tt> language and
provides a documentation and development assistance system. The
documentation system is in the style of <a
href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>
or <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a>, and
the development assitance system is (somehow) like a
pre-processor with its directives.</p>

<p><a href="Roxygen.pdf">Full Outline (pdf)</a></p>

<p><b>Project attributes:</b> Sophisticated project; student needs
to know <tt>R</tt> very well, especially the structural elements
like functions, S3/4 classes, generics, ..., and the student needs
some basic knowledge about writing a parser. At best, the student
has worked with Doxygen, Javadoc or another documentation
system.</p>

<h2>Ruml</h2>

<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~eugster/">Manuel
J. A. Eugster</a></p>

<p><tt>Ruml</tt> creates UML class diagrams from existing S classes
in the sense of <a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/">UMLGraph</a>
for Java classes. This is usefull for documentation and
exploration of existing packages: <tt>R</tt> specific things like
generic functions, namespaces, S3 and S4, ... should be
considered.</p>

<p><a href="Ruml.pdf">Full Outline (pdf)</a></p>

<p><b>Project attributes:</b> Easier project; student needs to
know the structual elements of <tt>R</tt> (like functions, S3/4
classes, generics, ...,) very well and has basic knowlegde about
UML (class diagrams).

<h2>Connecting R and PostgreSQL using DBI</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> Dirk Eddelbuettel (Email: edd at debian.org)

<p>
<b>Summary:</b> R has a the widely used database-abstraction interface
   'DBI' with support for MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, ... backends.
   Support for PostgreSQL would complement this.

<p>
<b>Required skills:</b> Knowledge of C programming is required; knowledge of
   R and SQL are beneficial.

<p> <b>Description:</b> The 'Database Interface' (DBI) package provides
an abstraction layer between R and the actual database backend.  This
requires 'glue code' for every given backend to provide the support
for the API exposed by DBI. R has DBI support for MySQL, SQLite and
Oracle backends, but not for PostgreSQL.  However, there is an
alternate interface package Rdbi with a matching RdbiPgSQL backend. It
appears that Rdbi has stalled in the sense that no other backend was
ever provided.  .  This SummerOfCode project consists of taking what
is already available via Rdbi as bringing it to the more widely-used
DBI framework.

<h2>cran2deb: Generate Debian packages for R from package sources</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b> Dirk Eddelbuettel (Email: edd at debian.org)

<p>
<b>Summary:</b> 
GNU R has become the preeminent platform for 'computing with
data'. The CRAN archives contain over 1300 source packages of very
high-quality, and BioConductor has again almost as many focuses on
bioinformatics. We want more of these in Debian, and going beyond the
50+ packages we currently have suggests more scripting and automation.


<p>
<b>Required skills:</b>
Familiarity with R, preferably actual programming experience;
alternatively programming experience in another scripting
language (Perl, Python, ...). Some familiarity with Debian
package building, C++ knowledge may be beneficial to
connect to apt's data structures. Basic SQL knowledge may
be helpful for the meta-data collection.

<p> <b>Description:</b> CRAN packages have in almost all cases
licenses which are suitable for Debian 'main'. Moreover, the internal
packaging and structure of these packages already resembles some of
the Debian meta-data, and the build process itself is
standardised. What is needed are a set of tools to collect package
meta-data (and the <a
href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/index.html" target="_top">CRANberries</a>
aggregator has one-half, apt has the other), 'map' the meta-data and
then script package fragments. While the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/AliothPkgBioc" target="_top">PkgBioc</a> project on
Alioth has done work in this area, it may be worthwhile to try a new
and simpler approach.
