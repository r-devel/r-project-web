	<h1>Projects 2008</h1>

	<p>The <i>R Foundation for Statistical Computing</i> has been participating in
	  <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/rf/about.html">Google
		Summer of Code 2008</a>. Based on the <a
		href="ideas.html">ideas list</a> the following projects and
	  students were selected and were sponsored by Google during
	  summer 2008 (sorted alphabetically by student):</p>

	<h2>lme4: Adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature method for mixed-effects models</h2>
	<i>by Bin Dai, mentored by Douglas M. Bates.</i>

	<p>This project continues to complete the package lme4 under
	  supervision of prof. Bates. Adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature
	  (AGQ) method will be used to evaluate the integrals. This method
	  can be implemented with arbitrary degrees of accuracy, leading
	  to nearly unbiased estimates, while first-order Laplacian
	  approximations have been reported to produce biased estimates
	  under some distributional scenarios.</p>

	<h2>Roxygen documentation system for R</h2>
	<i>by Peter Danenberg, mentored by Manuel J. A. Eugster.</i>
	
	<p>Roxygen is R's analogue to Doxygen; it aims to preserve
	  Doxygen's basic components: documentation blocks preceding code
	  objects which describe the objects with key-value pairs. Roxygen
	  will ship with the Documentation-, Namespace-, and
	  Collate-Roclets with produce, respectively, Rd, package
	  namespace, and collated package descriptions.</p>

	<h2>Finite Mixture Models for Large Data Sets</h2>
	<i>by Arijit Das, mentored by Friedrich Leisch.</i>

	<p>The main aim of this project would be to re-implement most
	  popular models of the flexmix package in C so that it is
	  feasible to mine large data sets. Since EM algorithm converges
	  only to a local minimum, it is recommended to repeat it several
	  times and for various number of components keeping only the best
	  solution found. In this project this part of the algorithm would
	  be parallelized for multi-CPU machines or clusters of
	  workstations to achieve greater efficiency.</p>

	<h2>Connecting R and PostgreSQL using DBI</h2>
	<i>by Sameer Kumar Prayaga, mentored by Dirk Eddelbuettel</i>.

	<p>The GSoC project involves creating an R add-on package that
	  provides the 'glue' between the DBI package and
	  PostgreSQL. This will bridge the existing gap for a DBI
	  connection between the premier Open Source data analysis
	  system R and the object-relational database management
	  system PostgreSQL.</p>
