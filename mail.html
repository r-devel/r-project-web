    <dd>The `main' <em>R</em> mailing list, for announcements
        about the development of <em>R</em> and the availability
        of new code, questions and answers about problems and
        solutions using <em>R</em>, enhancements and patches to
        the source code and documentation of <em>R</em>,
        comparison and compatibility with <em>S</em> and S-plus,
        and for the posting of nice examples and, benchmarks.<br>

<h2>General Instructions</h2>

<p>To send a message to everyone on the r-help mailing list, send
email to <a href="mailto:r-help@lists.R-project.org">r-help@lists.R-project.org</a>
.</p>

<p>To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to this list send ``subscribe'' (or
``unsubscribe'') in the <em>body</em> of the message (not in the
subject!) to <a href="mailto:r-help-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>
. Information about the list can be obtained by sending an email
with ``info'' as its contents to <a
href="mailto:r-help-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>
. </p>

<p>Subscription and posting to the other lists is done
analogously, with `r-help' replaced by `r-announce' and
`r-devel', respectively. Note that the r-announce list is
gatewayed into r-help, so you don't need to subscribe to both of
them. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than
only to the <em>R</em> developers (who are also subscribed to the
list, of course). This may save them precious time they can use
for constantly improving <em>R</em>, and will typically also
result in much quicker feedback for yourself. </p>

<p>Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful
to have code which reliably reproduces the problem. </p>


<h2>List Digests</h2>

Subscriptions to `r-help' and `r-devel' are also available in digest
format. With this option, several messages are compiled into a single
message for convenient reading by those who do not prefer immediate
receipt of individual messages. To get messages in digest format,
subscribe to the separate digest lists `r-help-digest' and `r-devel-digest',
respectively. You do not need to be subscribed to the regular lists if
you subscribe the digest lists (and vice versa).

E.g., to subscribe to r-help in digest format, send an email with the
word ``subscribe'' in the <em>body</em> of the message (not in the
subject!) to <a
href="mailto:r-help-digest-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help-digest<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>.

<h2>Mailing List Archives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Browsable HTML versions of the mail archives can be found on top of
      this page.

  <li>Unformatted text files of the <a
      href="http://cran.R-project.org/doc/mail-archives" target="_top">mail list
      archives</a> in standard Unix mailbox format can be downloaded from
      every CRAN mirror.
</ul>
