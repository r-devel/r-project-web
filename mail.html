<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="mailto:maechler@R-project.org">Martin
Maechler</a>, there are three mailing lists devoted to <em>R</em>:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>r-announce</strong></dt>
    <dd>This list is for announcements about the development of <em>R</em>
        and the availability of new code.<br>
	The list has a <em>low volume</em> (about one a week) and everyone
	mildly interested should consider subscribing, but note that R-help
	gets everything from R-announce as well, so you don't need to
	subscribe to both of them.
	As a very mild form of moderation, you can only post to R-announce
	when you are subscribed to either R-announce or R-help.

<br>
<em>
Note that we consider making R-announce completely "read-only" for the
public, to be used for announcements mainly by the R Core Development Team.
</em>

    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><strong>r-help</strong></dt>
    <dd>The `main' <em>R</em> mailing list, for announcements
        about the development of <em>R</em> and the availability
        of new code, questions and answers about problems and
        solutions using <em>R</em>, enhancements and patches to
        the source code and documentation of <em>R</em>,
        comparison and compatibility with <em>S</em> and S-plus,
        and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks.
	<br>
	This has become quite an active list with often dozens of
        messages per day.  An alternative is to subscribe to
	<a href="#digests"> <tt>r-help-digest</tt></a> instead, see below.

    <dt><strong>r-devel</strong></dt>
    <dd>This list is for discussions about the future of <em>R</em>
        and pre-testing of new versions. It is meant for those
        who maintain an active position in the development of <em>R</em>.

<h2>Archives and Search Facilities</h2>

<a name="archives">
<ul>
  <li>Browsable HTML versions of the mail archives can be found above.

  <li>Unformatted text files of the <a
      href="http://cran.R-project.org/doc/mail-archives" target="_top">mail list
      archives</a> in standard Unix mailbox format can be downloaded from
      every CRAN mirror.
  <li>Have a look at CRAN's <a
  href="http://cran.R-project.org/search.html">search page</a> for
  searchable versions of the mailing list archives.
</ul>

<h2>General Instructions</h2>

<a name="instructions">
<p>To send a message to everyone on the r-help mailing list, send
email to
<a href="mailto:r-help@lists.R-project.org">r-help@lists.R-project.org</a>.
<br>
Note that you should configure your e-mail software in such a way as to
send only <strong>plain text</strong>, i.e. <strong>no HTML</strong>.
``HTML''ified messages are usually considerably longer (in bytes!) and
harder to filter for spam.  Many of these are currently filtered and would
need manual interaction of the list maintainer.
</p>

<p>To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to this list send ``subscribe'' (or
``unsubscribe'') in the <em>body</em> of the message (not in the
subject!) to <a href="mailto:r-help-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>
. Information about the list can be obtained by sending an email
with ``info'' as its contents to <a
href="mailto:r-help-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>
. </p>

<p>Subscription and posting to the other lists is done
analogously, with `r-help' replaced by `r-announce' and
`r-devel', respectively. Note that the r-announce list is
gatewayed into r-help, so you don't need to subscribe to both of
them. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than
only to the <em>R</em> developers (who are also subscribed to the
list, of course). This may save them precious time they can use
for constantly improving <em>R</em>, and will typically also
result in much quicker feedback for yourself. </p>

<p>Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful
to have code which reliably reproduces the problem, see the
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R%20Bugs">
   entry in the R FAQ</a>.
</p>


<h2>List Digests</h2>

<a name="digests">
Subscriptions to `r-help' and `r-devel' are also available in digest
format. With this option, several messages are compiled into a single
currently <em>daily</em> message for convenient reading by those who do not
prefer immediate receipt of individual messages.

<br>
<strong>NOTE (2002-11-15):</strong>
<em> The R mailing lists are being transfered from the majordomo to the
  <a href="http://www.list.org/">mailman</a> software.
  There, digestification is a switch you can turn on or off.</em>
  <br>

  <em>2002-11-18: R-devel is now managed via mailman.
  The <tt>R-devel-digest</tt> list no longer exists separately.</em>
  <br>

To get messages in digest format for R-help, currently subscribe to the
separate digest list `r-help-digest'.
<br>
Since this will change very soon, you may consider waiting for that.
<br>
To subscribe to r-help in digest format, send an email with the
word ``subscribe'' in the <em>body</em> of the message (not in the
subject!) to <a
href="mailto:r-help-digest-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help-digest<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>.
