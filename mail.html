<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="mailto:maechler@R-project.org">Martin
Maechler</a>, there are three mailing lists devoted to <em>R</em>:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>r-announce</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>This list is for announcements about the development of <em>R</em>
        and the availability of new code.<br>
	The list has a <em>low volume</em> (about one a week) and everyone
	mildly interested should consider subscribing, but note that R-help
	gets everything from R-announce as well, so you don't need to
	subscribe to both of them.</p>

	<p>
	Note that the list is <em> moderated </em> to be used for
	announcements mainly by the R Core Development Team.
	<br>
	Use the <a
	href="http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce">
	web interface</a> for information, subscription, archives, etc.
	</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><strong>r-help</strong></dt>
    <dd>The `main' <em>R</em> mailing list, for announcements
        about the development of <em>R</em> and the availability
        of new code, questions and answers about problems and
        solutions using <em>R</em>, enhancements and patches to
        the source code and documentation of <em>R</em>,
        comparison and compatibility with <em>S</em> and S-plus,
        and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks.
	<p>
	This has become quite an active list with often dozens of
        messages per day.  An alternative is to subscribe and choose daily
	digests (in plain or MIME format).
	<br>
	Use the <a href="http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">
	web interface</a> for information, subscription, archives, etc.
    </dd>

    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><strong>r-devel</strong></dt>
    <dd>This list is for discussions about the future of <em>R</em>
        and pre-testing of new versions. It is meant for those
        who maintain an active position in the development of <em>R</em>.
	<p>
	If you don't want to receive more than a daily message, you
	can subscribe and choose digests (in plain or MIME format).
	<br>
	Use the <a href="http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel">
	web interface</a> for information, subscription, archives, etc.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Archives and Search Facilities</h2>

<a name="archives">
<ul>
  <li>Browsable HTML versions of the mail archives can be found at the <a
  	href="http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo"> web interface</a>.

  <li>Unformatted text files of the <a
      href="http://cran.R-project.org/doc/mail-archives" target="_top">mail list
      archives</a> in standard Unix mailbox format can be downloaded from
      every CRAN mirror.
  <li>Have a look at CRAN's <a
  href="http://cran.R-project.org/search.html">search page</a> for
  searchable versions of the mailing list archives.
</ul>

<h2>General Instructions</h2>

<a name="instructions">
Note that you should configure your e-mail software in such a way as to
send only <strong>plain text</strong>, i.e., <strong>no HTML</strong>.
`HTML-ified' messages are usually considerably longer (in bytes!) and
harder to filter for spam.  Many of these (e.g. `HTML-only' ones) are
currently intercepted completely.
<!-- and would need manual interaction of the list maintainer. -->

<p>To send a message to everyone on the r-help mailing list, send
email to
<a href="mailto:r-help@lists.R-project.org">r-help@lists.R-project.org</a>.
<br>
</p>

<p> Information about the list can be obtained by sending an email
with `info' as its contents to <a
href="mailto:r-help-request@lists.R-project.org">r-help<b>-request</b>@lists.R-project.org</a>.
<cr>
Note that you <em>can</em> can subscribe and unsubscribe <b>by E-mail</b>
(instead of the web interface), however to unsubscribe you currently need the
mailing list password which is get when subscribing and in a monthly reminder.
</p>

<p>Subscription and posting to the other lists is done
analogously, with `r-help' replaced by `r-announce' and
`r-devel', respectively. Note that the r-announce list is
gatewayed into r-help, so you don't need to subscribe to both of
them. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than
only to the <em>R</em> developers (who are also subscribed to the
list, of course). This may save them precious time they can use
for constantly improving <em>R</em>, and will typically also
result in much quicker feedback for yourself. </p>

<p>Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful
to have code which reliably reproduces the problem, see the
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R%20Bugs">
   entry in the R FAQ</a>.
