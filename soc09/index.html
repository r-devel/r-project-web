	<h1>Projects 2009</h1>	

	<p>The R Foundation for Statistical Computing is participating in
	  <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/rf">Google Summer of Code 2009</a>. 
	  Based on the <a href="ideas.html">ideas list</a> the following
	  projects and students are selected and are sponsored by Google
	  during summer 2008 (sorted alphabetically by student):</p>
	

	<hr/>
	<h2>Implementation of the CRUISE algorithm</h2>
	<i>by Eva Hoermann, mentored by Torsten Hothorn.</i>

	<p>The aim of the project is the implementation of recursive
	  partitioning methods ("trees") which aren't available in R at
	  the moment. The student can choose a method to begin with from a
	  larger set of interesting algorithms.</p>


	<hr/>
	<h2>cranlab -- "You can't control what you can't measure"</h2>
	<i>by Mariane Machado, mentored by Manuel J. A. Eugster.</i>

	<p>The aim of this project is the (1) implementation of software
	  metrics to analyze R packages and (2) the creation of a CRAN
	  software metrics monitor.</p>


	<hr/>
	<h2>Development of crantastic.org</h2>
	<i>by Bjorn Arild Maeland, mentored by Hadley Wickham.</i>

	<p>Create an information portal for the fast growing list of R
	  packages, integrating package documentation and journal
	  publications with feedback from the useR community.</p>


	<hr/>
	<h2>RQuantLib - Bridging R and QuantLib</h2>
	<i>by Khanh Nguyen, mentored by Dirk Eddelbuettel.</i>

	<p>The goal of this Summer of Code project is to (1.) extend the
	  coverage of QuantLib code available to R by adding more wrapper
	  functions to RQuantLib, and to (2.) provide additional
	  functionality to QuantLib by leveraging the numerous statistical
	  facilities in R -- this could be anything from standard to
	  robust estimation methods, data visualization or report creation
	  via tools like Sweave.</p>
