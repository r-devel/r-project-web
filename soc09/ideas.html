	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley
		Wickham</a>.</p>
	
	<p><b>Summary:</b> Create an information portal for the fast
	  growing list of R packages, integrating package documentation
	  and journal publications with feedback from the useR
	  community.</p>
	
    <p><b>Required skills:</b> Familiarity with Ruby and R, and web
	  development in general (html, css, js, ...). knowledge of
	  RSS/Atom could be useful.</p>
	
	<p><b>Description:</b> The CRAN archives contain over 1300 source packages of
	  very high-quality, and BioConductor has another 200+. For many data
	  analytic tasks there is more than one package offering a solution,
	  often using different names for similar functionality, because
	  different research communities may use different vocabulary for
	  similar methods (e.g., statistics vs. machine learning jargon). Hence
	  it is often hard for users to find the packages they really need. CRAN
	  task views offer some help, but are edited by designated maintainers
	  and hence cannot cover all fields and aspects.</p>

	<p><a href="http://crantastic.org">crantastic.org</a> implements a first
	  step in complementing this with package reviews from the useR
	  community, but it still lacks many features we would like to
	  have: integration with task views, vignettes, and journal
	  publications; match authors and users based on email address;
	  list top users and authors on respective pages; implement a
	  rating system; event streams for packages and users; integration
	  with <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/cran/new/">CRANberries</a>
	  RSS feed, etc.</p>

	<p><b>Programming exercise:</b> If you're interested in this
	  project take a look at the current code, available at <a
		href="https://github.com/hadley/crantastic/tree">https://github.com/hadley/crantastic/tree</a>, 
	  and include a couple of concrete suggestions as to how you would
	  improve the current code, and how you plan to implement the
	  additional features.</p>

	<h2><a name="p2">Movement Ecology add-ons for adehabitat package</a></h2>

	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
		href="http://uninsubria.academia.edu/DamianoGPreatoni">Damiano
		G. Preatoni</a>.</p>

	<p><b>Summary:</b> Develop some add-on functions to use the
	  adehabitat package to perform basic movement ecology analysis,
	  in particular analysis of fractal dimension D. Developed
	  functions could possibly be included in a future release of the
	  adehabitat package itself.</p>

	<p><b>Required skills:</b> The candidate should be both familiar
	  with R programming and wildlife radiotracking data analysis. A
	  minimal familiarity with the adehabitat code could be
	  desirable.</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> Fractal dimension analysis is an useful
	  tool to better understand not just the 'path tortuosity', in an
	  animal's trajectory, but also the scale level at which 'search
	  patterns' occur, i.e. an indirect index of the scale at which
	  habtat resources are 'perceived'.</p>

	<p>It has already been shown using simulations (Nams 2005;
	  Oecologia 143: 179-188) that the fractal dimension D of a
	  trajectory changes within scales, and that the fractal dimension
	  could be a valuable tool in multiscale analysis of wildlife
	  movement patterns.</p>
	
	<p>The adehabitat package, increasingly used as a free-open source
	  alternative in radiiotracking and animal habitat selection
	  studies, already has base functions to deal with trajectories in
	  time and space, both as regular samples (e.g. data from GPS radio
	  tags) and as irregular ones (as in 'classic' VHF
	  radiotraking). The implementation of the algorithms devised by
	  Nams could widen the range of analytical instruments that already
	  make adehabitat an almost complete tool.</p>

	<p>Moreover, the author of the sole existing software to do
	  fractal analysis (<a
		href="http://nsac.ca/envsci/staff/vnams/Fractal.htm">V.O. Nams</a>)
	  has expressed no objection towards such a porting (as reported
	  by Paolo Cavallini in the <a
		href="http://www.nabble.com/fractals-to21875728.html">AniMov
		mailing list</a>), suggesting that a complete rewrite could be
	  a better solution.</p>

	<p>In detail, the project objectives will be to port (or rewrite)
	  into R the 'standard' methods offered by the FRACTAL program:
	</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>fractal dimension estimation (D) using the basic divider
		  method.</li>
		<li>estimation of D the resampling divider method (Nams 2006:
		  Acta Biotheoretica 54:1-11).</li>
		<li>estimation of D using the VFractal estimator (Nams, 1996:
		  Landscape Ecology 11:289-297).</li>
		<li>production of other relevant movement ecology statistics
		  useful in spetial scale perception by animals (Nams 2006:
		  Animal Behaviour. 72: 1197-1203).</li>
		<li>optionally, in conjunction with the random movement
		  simulators already  present in adehabitat (in particular
		  simm.levy and simm.crw), test for deviations from a CRW
		  model (Nams and Bourgeois 2004: Can J. Zool, 82:1738-1747)
		  and detect if oriented movements occur (Nams 2006: Animal
		  Behaviour. 72: 1197-1203)</li>
	  </ul>

	<p><b><a href="http://xkcd.com/74/">Programming exercise</a>:</b>
	  The candidate should demonstrate to be able to transform raw
	  irregular VHF radiotracking data into an adehabitat ltraj
	  object, which could be the base data structure to work with in
	  the proposed package.</p>

	<h2><a name="p3">Party On! New Recursive Partytioning Tools</a></h2>
	
	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~hothorn/">Torsten
		Hothorn</a> and <a href="http://statmath.wu-wien.ac.at/~zeileis/">
			Achim Zeileis</a>.</p>

	<p><b>Summary:</b> The aim of the project is the implementation of
	  recursive partitioning methods ("trees") which aren't available
	  in R at the moment. The student can choose a method to begin
	  with from a larger set of interesting algorithms.</p>

	<p><b>Required skills:</b> Good R programming skills, depending on
	  the complexity of the chosen algorithm C programming might be
	  required as well. A basic understanding of statistics and
	  machine learning would be helpful.</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> Recursive partitioning methods, or simply
	"trees", are simple yet powerful methods for capturing regression
	relationships. Since the publication of the automated interaction
	detection (AID) algorithm in 1964, many extensions, modifications,
	and new approaches have been suggested in both the statistics and
	machine learning communities. Most of the standard algorithms are
	available to the R user, e.g., through packages rpart, party,
	mvpart, and RWeka.</p>

	<p>However, no common infrastructure is available for representing
	trees fitted by different packages. Consequently, the capabilities
	for extraction of information - such as predictions, printed
	summaries, or visualizations - vary between packages and come with
	somewhat different user interfaces. Furthermore, extensions or
	modifications often require considerable programming effort, e.g.,
	if the median instead of the mean of a numerical response should
	be predicted in each leaf of an rpart tree.  Similarly,
	implementations of new tree algorithms might also require new
	infrastructure if they have features not available in the
	above-mentioned packages, e.g., multi-way splits or more complex
	models in the leafs.</p>

	<p>To overcome these difficulties, the partykit package has been
	started on R-Forge. It is still being developed but already
	contains a stable class "party" for representing trees. It is a
	very flexible class with unified predict(), print(), and plot()
	methods, and can, in principle, capture all trees mentioned. But
	going beyond that, it can also accommodate multi-way or functional
	splits, as well as complex models in (leaf) nodes.</p>
	
	<p>We aim at making more recursive partitioning methods available
	to the R community. A first step in this direction is the CHAID
	package (also hosted on R-Forge). Much more prominent procedures
	come to mind, for example exhaustive CHAID, C4.5, GUIDE, CRUISE,
	LOTUS, and many others.  Students can choose among these and other
	recursive partitioning methods they want to implement based on the
	partykit infrastructure.</p>

	<p><b>Programming exercise:</b> Consider the "GlaucomaM" dataset
	from package ipred. Write a small R function that searches for the
	best binary split in variable "vari" when "Class" is the response
	variable. Implement any method you like but without using any
	add-on package.</p>

	<h2><a name="p4">cranlab -- "You can't control what you can't measure"</a></h2>

	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
		href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~eugster/">Manuel
		J. A. Eugster</a></p>

	<p><b>Summary:</b> The aim of this project is the (1)
	  implementation of software metrics to analyze R packages and (2)
	  the creation of a CRAN software metrics monitor.</p>

	<p><b>Required skills:</b> Good R programming skills. Basic
	  knowledge of software engineering and software metrics
	  measurements are useful.</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> Software metrics are measures of some
	  properties of software. In software engineering they are used to
	  monitor improvement of projects; common metrics include 'source
	  lines of code', 'code coverage' or 'software package metrics'
	  (see, e.g., <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metrics">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

	<p>First step of this project is the implementation of an R
	  package which calculates software metrics of R packages. The
	  implementation must be flexible, i.e., a basic set of metrics
	  will be implemented, but others can be added later on.</p>

	<p>Second step is the creation of a CRAN software metrics
	  monitor. This means a service which continuously calculates
	  software metrics of CRAN packages and provides the (raw)
	  data. As a first analyzing step a dashboard provides simple
	  basic plots of the data.</p>

	<p>"You can't control what you can't measure" is stated by Tom
	  DeMarco, Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement
	  and Estimation.</p>

	<p><b>Programming exercise:</b> How many functions has the
	  <a href="http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/archetypes/">archetypes</a> 
	  package? Write some R code which counts them.</p>

	<h2><a name="p5">Integrated debugger</a></h2>

	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a
		href="http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/">Romain
		Francois</a></p>

	<p><b>Summary:</b> Create an integrated debugger.</p>

	<p><b>Required skills:</b> R skills. Experience of using a
	  debugger. Front-end  skills depending on the chosen
	  front-end(s).</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> Debugging R code usually involves a lot of
	  work from the command line with the use of functions such as
	  browser, debug, trace, recover. The debug package provides
	  additional debugging functionalities and concepts to R internal
	  debugging capabilities: code display, graceful error recovery,
	  line-numbered conditional breakpoints, access to exit code, flow
	  control, and full keyboard input.</p>

	<p>The current front-end used by the debug package is based on
	  tcltk, and although tcltk offers universal portability wherever
	  R is installed, it does not compete with current alternatives in
	  terms of user-experience.</p>

	<p>The goal of this project is to create an integrated debugger
	  for R, based on the debug package but coupled with another
	  front-end. Possible front-ends are listed below, ordered by
	  current experience of the mentor.</p>
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="http://biocep-distrib.r-forge.r-project.org/">biocep</a>
		  [java,swing]</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-K/index.html">sciviews-k</a>
		  [mozilla,javascript]</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.walware.de/goto/statet">statet</a>
		  [java,eclipse,swt]</li>
	  </ul>

	<p><b>Programming exercise:</b> If you are interested in the
	  project: If you are coming from an R standpoint, have a look at
	  the debug package and make a few design suggestions about how
	  the package could be modified to support alternative
	  front-ends. If you come from a front-end standpoint, make a few
	  suggestions on how you would present the information.</p>

	<h2><a name="p6">RQuantLib -- Bridging R and QuantLib</a></h2>

	<p><b>Mentor:</b> <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/">Dirk
		Eddelbuettel</a></p>

	<p><b>Summary:</b> The goal of this Summer of Code project is to</p>
	  <ol type="a">
		<li>extend the coverage of <a href="http://www.quantlib.org">QuantLib</a>
		  code available to R by adding more wrapper functions to 
		  <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQuantLib/index.html">RQuantLib</a>
		  <a href="#p6r">(*)</a>, and to</li> 
		<li>provide additional functionality to QuantLib by leveraging
		  the numerous statistical facilities in R -- this could be
		  anything from standard to robust estimation methods, data
		  visualization or report creation via tools like Sweave.</li>
	  </ol>

	<p><b>Required skills:</b> Good R and C++ programming skills. At
	  least some familiarity with basic open source tools like svn,
	  make, ... is beneficial as well. Some understanding of financial
	  economics may be helpful but is not required.</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> QuantLib, the premier free/open-source
	  library for modeling, trading, and risk management, provides a
	  comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance.
	  QuantLib has been developed since Nov 2000 and is now
	  approaching an initial 1.0 release at which point the API will
	  be frozen.  This makes it a good point in time to start building
	  more code on top of the API.</p>

	<p>RQuantLib, first released in 2002 as a proof-of-concept,
	  provides a subset of the available QuantLib functonality. Many
	  more asset classed and methods are now available.</p>

	<p>This Summer of Code project provides ample scope for a student
	  to first learn about possible extensions to RQuantLib, to learn
	  about interfaces from R to underlying libraries and back, and to
	  then design, architect and implement some meaningful
	  extension.</p>

	<p><b>Programming exercise:</b> Take the current RQuantLib package
	  and provide a new function that exposes functionality from
	  QuantLib to R, preferably with a tests/ file and a help file.</p>
