<h1>Guidelines for moderating the R-help mailing list</h1>

 <p>
 <b>Remember</b>:
 The main goal is to keep the list open to non-subscribers.
 However it is not a problem if they have to wait a couple of hours
 before their posting is approved. As a matter of fact, that will remain
 an incentive to become subscribers.
 <br>
 Consequently, moderators should really only look at the moderation
 web page a couple of time times during 'duty day', and not more.
 </p>

<p><b>Main rule:</b>
  You should typically <strong>NOT reject</strong> anything;
  rather either <strong>approve</strong> (non-subscriber postings) or
  <strong>discard</strong> (spam).
  <br>
  As with most interesting rules, there will be exceptions, see below.
</p>

<p><b>"Duty" Days:</b>
 In order that you don't tread on each others' toes,
 for each day of the week, we'll have one or two (maybe three) moderators
 assigned.
 <br>

 If there are two (or more) moderators assigned to a specific day,
 please coordinate on your own how you will typically handle "the day".
 <br>

 If you know in advance that you won't be able to attend a given duty day,
 please try to make sure another moderator takes over from you.

<p><b>E-mail notifications:</b>
 Note that currently all of you will receive e-mails
 about pending moderations, both
 <ol>
   <li> <em>when they happen</em>  and
   <li> a daily <em>summary of all pendings</em>
 </ol>

 Probably, we will turn off the first ('1.') pretty soon,
 but, moderators, please voice your opinion about this.

<p><b><em>Rare</em> Rejections:</b>
  The following are considerations some of which may well be revised in the
  future.
 <ol>
 <li> do <em>never</em> reject "professional" spam (Viagra, Stocks,...),
   but rather disgard it; rejecting only helps the spam mafia.
 <li> Maybe reject (instead of discard) ``mass e-mailings'' that are
   only very remotely related to the R software or the R community.
   <br>

   I would approve "Computational Statistics" conference announcements,
   but not a general ISI or JSM conference announcement.
   I might <b>reject</b> that, in the hope the sender will learn.
   <br>

   This <em>is</em> a matter of taste though, and moderators will slightly
   differ here.

 <li> It will happen that clueless newbies post, then see that the message
   is hold, and will wrongly conclude that they should just try again.

   This will lead to multiple postings from the same poster typically with
   the same or similar subject.

   In such cases, <b>approve only one</b> of the multiple postings,
   and reject the others, so the newbie can learn.

   <br>
    <br>

  <li> ... (more to come ..) ...
 </ol>
