<H1>R-related Conferences</h1>


The R project actively supports two conference series, organized
regularly by members from the R community: useR! - providing a forum
to the R user community - and DSC - a platform for developers of
statistical software. A rough outline of the format for the respective
conferences is given below; both conference formats were developed by
the <a href="http://statmath.wu-wien.ac.at/AASC/"
target="_top">Austrian Association for Statistical Computing (AASC)
</a> in cooperation with the <a
href="http://www.R-project.org/foundation" target="_top">R Foundation
for Statistical Computing</a>.

<h2>useR! - International R User Conference</h2>

<img src="useR.png" align="right">
This is the main meeting of the R user and developer community,
its program consisting of both invited and user-contributed
presentations:
<ul>
  <li> The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of 
    topics ranging from technical and R-related computing
    issues to general statistical topics of current interest.
  <li> The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts
    prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually)
    any R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized
    in sessions of either broad or special interest, which also
    comprise a "free" discussion format. Such a discussion format
    not only provides a forum for software demonstrations and 
    detailed discussions but also supports the self-organization
    of the respective communities.
</ul>
Usually, no proceedings are published for useR! conferences.

<h2>DSC - Directions in Statistical Computing
</h2>

<img align=right src="dsc.png" width=128>
DSC is a conference for the developers of statistical software and
researchers in statistical computing which is somewhat focused on but
not exclusively devoted to R. It aims at providing a platform for
exchanging ideas about developments in statistical computing (rather
than `only' the usage of statistical software for applications). As the
associated papers are often technical and difficult to publish even in
computational statistical journals, the DSC publishes post-conference
proceedings of the papers that were accepted for publication.
