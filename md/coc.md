title: "Code of Conduct for R Conferences"
---

This is the standard code of conduct referred to in the [Code of Conduct Policy](coc-policy.html).

Organizers should replace the placeholders (marked by square brackets) with relevant details for 
their conference.

## Code of Conduct

The organizers of [conference] are dedicated to providing a 
harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of age,
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or 
religion (or lack thereof). 

All participants (including attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers) at [conference] are 
required to agree to the following code of conduct. 

The code of conduct 
applies to all conference activities including talks, panels, workshops, and 
social events. It extends to conference-specific exchanges on social media, for instance posts tagged 
with the identifier of the conference (e.g. [#conference] on Twitter), replies to such posts, and replies to 
the official social media account (e.g. [@conference] on Twitter). 

Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a 
safe environment for all. 

## Expected Behaviour

All conference participants agree to:

- Be considerate in language and actions, and respect the boundaries of fellow participants.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and 
language.  Please refer to [Unacceptable Behaviour](#unacceptable-behaviour) for more details. 
- Alert a member of the code of conduct response team [reference to 
further details] if you notice someone in distress, or observe violations 
of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. Please refer to the section titled [What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behaviour](#what-to-do-if-you-witness-or-are-subject-to-unacceptable-behaviour) for more details. 

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Behaviour that is unacceptable includes, but is not limited to:

 - Stalking
 - Deliberate intimidation
 - Unwanted photography or recording
 - Sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events
 - Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
 - Offensive comments related to age, gender, 
 sexual orientation, disability, race or religion
 - Inappropriate physical contact, which can include grabbing, or massaging 
 or hugging without consent.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate 
 questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favours or 
 repeatedly asking for dates or contact information.

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour you should stop 
immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a 
joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all 
conference attendees you should stop.

Attendees who behave in a manner deemed inappropriate are subject to actions listed under [Procedure for Code of Conduct Violations](#procedure-for-code-of-conduct-violations).

### Additional Requirements for Conference Contributions

Presentation slides and posters should not contain offensive or 
sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the
topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the 
existence of this material should be noted in the abstract and, in the
case of oral contributions, at the start of the talk or session.

### Additional Requirements for Sponsors

Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or 
other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use 
sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a 
sexualised environment. In case of violations, sanctions may be 
applied without return of sponsorship contribution.

## Procedure for Code of Conduct Violations

The organizing committee reserves the right to determine the appropriate response for all code of conduct violations. Potential responses include:

 - a formal warning to stop harassing behaviour
 - expulsion from the conference
 - removal of sponsor displays or conference posters
 - cancellation or early termination of talks or other contributions to the program

Refunds may not be given in case of expulsion.

## What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behaviour

[Details of the local implementation of the code of conduct should be given here, 
including specific details of how participants should report a violation and 
how reports will be handled. See the code of conduct pages for useR! 2020 
onwards for examples.]
