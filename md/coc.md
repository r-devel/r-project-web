title: "Code of Conduct for R Conferences"
---

This is the standard code of conduct referred to in the [Code of Conduct Policy](coc-policy.html).

Organizers should replace the placeholders (marked by square brackets) with relevant details for 
their conference.

## Code of Conduct

The organizers of [conference] are dedicated to providing a 
harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of age,
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or 
religion (or lack thereof). 

All participants (including attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers) at [conference] are 
required to agree to the following code of conduct. The code of conduct 
applies to all conference activities including talks, panels, workshops, and 
social events. It extends to conference-specific exchanges on social media, for instance posts tagged 
with the identifier of the conference (e.g. [#conference] on Twitter), replies to such posts, and replies to 
the official social media account (e.g. [@conference] on Twitter). 

Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a 
safe environment for all. There will be a dedicated team to respond to code of conduct 
concerns during the conference [link/reference to further details], reports made to the response 
team will be treated confidentially.

Participants engaging in harassing behaviour may be 
given a formal warning to stop harassing behaviour and expelled if 
they continue, or in a severe case immediately expelled from the conference. 
Refunds may not be given in case of expulsion. The organizers reserve the rights to remove sponsor displays,
take down conference posters and to cancel or stop talks or other
contributions early, as a result of code of conduct violations.

All conference participants agree to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and respect the boundaries of fellow participants.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and 
speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: 
    - Stalking
    - Deliberate intimidation
    - Unwanted photography or recording
    - Sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events
    - Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
    - Offensive verbal comments related to age, gender, 
    sexual orientation, disability, race or religion
    - Inappropriate physical contact, which can include grabbing, or massaging 
    or hugging without consent.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate 
    questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favours or 
    repeatedly asking for dates or contact information.
- Alert a member of the code of conduct response team [reference to 
further details] if you notice someone in distress, or observe violations 
of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour you should stop 
immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a 
joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all 
conference attendees you should stop.

### Additional Requirements for Conference Contributions

Presentation slides and posters should not contain offensive or 
sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the
topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the 
existence of this material should be noted in the abstract and, in the
case of oral contributions, at the start of the talk or session.

### Additional Requirements for Sponsors

Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or 
other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use 
sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a 
sexualised environment. In case of violations, sanctions may be 
applied without return of sponsorship contribution.
