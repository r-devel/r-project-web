title: Conferences
---

The R project actively supports two conference series, organized regularly by members from the R community: useR! - providing a forum to the R user community - and DSC - a platform for developers of statistical software. A rough outline of the format for the respective conferences is given below; both conference formats were developed by the [Austrian Association for Statistical Computing (AASC)](http://www.aasc.or.at/) in cooperation with the [R Foundation for Statistical Computing](http://www.R-project.org/foundation).

R-related conferences are coordinated by the *"R Foundation Conference Committee"* (RFCC) currently consisting of [Torsten Hothorn (Universität Zürich)](http://www.biostat.uzh.ch/aboutus/people/hothorn.html) and [Achim Zeileis (Universität Innsbruck)](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/~zeileis/) plus ex officio [secretary and treasurer](foundation/board.html) of the R Foundation. The RFCC can be contacted by email at `R-conferences@r-project.org`.

## useR! - International R User Conference

![useR logo](useR.png)\ 

This is the main meeting of the R user and developer community, its program consisting of both invited and user-contributed presentations:

-   The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from technical and R-related computing issues to general statistical topics of current interest.
-   The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually) any R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized in sessions of either broad or special interest, which also comprise a "free" discussion format. Such a discussion format not only provides a forum for software demonstrations and detailed discussions but also supports the self-organization of the respective communities.

Usually, no proceedings are published for useR! conferences.

## DSC - Directions in Statistical Computing

![DSC logo](dsc.png) DSC is a conference for the developers of statistical software and researchers in statistical computing which is somewhat focused on but not exclusively devoted to R. It aims at providing a platform for exchanging ideas about developments in statistical computing (rather than \`only' the usage of statistical software for applications). As the associated papers are often technical and difficult to publish even in computational statistical journals, the DSC publishes post-conference proceedings of the papers that were accepted for publication.
