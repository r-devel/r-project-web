Projects focusing on special application areas, statistical models, etc.

### Bioconductor: Bioinformatics with R
<http://www.bioconductor.org>

The broad goals of Bioconductor are to

-   provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data;
-   facilitate the integration of biological metadata in the analysis of experimental data: e.g. literature data from PubMed, annotation data from LocusLink;
-   allow the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software;
-   promote high-quality and reproducible research;
-   provide training in computational and statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data.

## Computational Infrastructure

Projects focusing on computational infrastructure, user interfaces, web-based services, etc.

### Omegahat: Distributed Statistical Computing
<http://www.omegahat.org>

Omega is a joint project with the goal of providing a variety of open-source software for statistical applications. The Omega project began with discussions among designers responsible for three current statistical languages (S, R, and Lisp-Stat), with the idea of working together on new directions with special emphasis on web-based software, Java, the Java virtual machine, and distributed computing. Omega encourages participation by anyone wanting to extend computing capabilities in one of the existing languages, to those interested in distributed or web-based statistical software, and to those interested in the design of new statistical languages.

### ESS: Emacs speaks Statistics
<http://ess.R-project.org/>
