title: "Code of Conduct Policy"
---

Conferences organized or endorsed by the R Foundation must have a 
code of conduct in order to ensure an experience free from harassment 
for all participants. We encourage other R meetings not affiliated 
with the R Foundation to adopt the same policy.

A code of conduct serves two important purposes. Firstly, it sends a 
clear message to those outside the community that an R conference is 
a professional and comfortable working environment for all 
participants. Secondly, it provides a mechanism for reporting and 
handling any incidents of harassment that may occur.

We have adopted a standard [code of conduct](coc.html)
for conference organizers to use; use of an alternative code of conduct or 
alterations to this standard code of conduct should be approved by the R 
Foundation Conferences Committee (RFCC). Conference organizers are responsible
for ensuring the code of conduct is enforced, in particular: 

1. Placing the code of conduct in a prominent position on the 
conference website.
2. Making agreement to the code of conduct part of the terms and 
conditions for registration and sponsorship.

Further guidelines are provided by the RFCC to conference organisers to assist 
with implementing the code of conduct.
