**News**: [call for proposals](/useR-2021_call.html) to host useR! 2021.

The R Foundation actively supports two conference series, organized regularly by members from the R community:

* useR!, providing a forum to the R user community.
* DSC, a platform for developers of statistical software.

A rough outline of the format for the respective conferences is given below; both conference formats were developed by the [Austrian Association for Statistical Computing (AASC)](http://www.aasc.or.at/) in cooperation with the [R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/foundation).

The R Foundation is also endorsing a small number of conferences in under-supported regions to encourage the development of the local R community, particularly in academic and scientific research. Endorsed events are listed below.

Conference-related activities are co-ordinated by the *"R Foundation Conference Committee"* (RFCC) currently consisting of
[Julie Josse (Ecole Polytechnique)](http://juliejosse.com/), [Heather Turner](http://www.heatherturner.net/) and [Achim Zeileis (Universität Innsbruck)](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/~zeileis/) plus ex officio [secretary and treasurer](foundation/board.html) of the R Foundation. The RFCC can be contacted by email at <R-conferences@r-project.org>.

The R Foundation has a [policy](/coc-policy.html) requiring a [code of conduct](/coc.html) at R conferences.

## useR! --- International R User Conference

![useR logo](useR.png)\

**useR! 2020** will be held in St. Louis, Missouri from July 7 to July 10 at 
the Marriott St. Louis Grand. 
Follow ['@useR2020stl'](https://twitter.com/useR2020stl) for further news.

The [call for proposals](/useR-2021_call.html) to host useR! 2021 is now open, the deadline is **Friday 01 November 2019**.

useR! is the main meeting of the R user and developer community, its program consisting of both invited and user-contributed presentations:

-   The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from technical and R-related computing issues to general statistical topics of current interest.
-   The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually) any R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized in sessions of regular talks, lightning talks, and poster presentations.
-   The RFCC actively invites potential local organisers to submit proposals regarding future useR! conferences. Groups thinking about hosting a useR! conference are welcome to contact the RFCC by email at <R-conferences@r-project.org>.

Usually, no proceedings are published for useR! conferences.

## DSC --- Directions in Statistical Computing

![DSC logo](dsc.png)\

DSC is a conference for the developers of statistical software and researchers in statistical computing which is somewhat focused on but not exclusively devoted to R. It aims at providing a platform for exchanging ideas about developments in statistical computing (rather than \`only' the usage of statistical software for applications).

DSC has had two different incarnations. The first was a biennial conference series from 1999 to 2009 with open registration, an open call for papers and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. After a 5 year hiatus, DSC resumed in 2014 as an annual conference coinciding with the General Assembly of the R Foundation. In its current form, participation in DSC is by invitation only.

##  Other Conferences Endorsed by The R Foundation

Endorsement of other conferences is a new initiative intended to encourage the development of useR!-like meetings in regions beyond the reach of useR!, where the local R community is not so well-established. These meetings may have official languages other than English.

* [ConectaR](https://www.conectar2019.org) [Spanish] January, 2019, San José, Costa Rica.
