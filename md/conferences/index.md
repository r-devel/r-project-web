**News**: The [**useR! 2025**](https://user2025.r-project.org) conference will take place at Duke University, in Durham, NC, USA, August 8-10. 

------------

The R Foundation actively supports two conference series, organized regularly by members from the R community:

* useR!, a forum for the R user community.
* DSC, a platform for developers of statistical software.

A rough outline of the format for the respective conferences is given below; both conference formats were developed by the [Austrian Association for Statistical Computing (AASC)](https://statmath.wu.ac.at/AASC/) in cooperation with the [R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/).

The R Foundation also [endorses a small number of conferences](#other-conferences-endorsed-by-the-r-foundation) for special events or to encourage the development of the local R community in under-supported regions.

Conference-related activities are co-ordinated by the *"R Foundation Conference Committee"* (RFCC) currently consisting of
[Julie Josse (Ecole Polytechnique)](https://juliejosse.com/), [Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/) and [Achim Zeileis (Universität Innsbruck)](https://www.zeileis.org/) plus ex officio [secretary and treasurer](foundation/board.html) of the R Foundation. The RFCC can be contacted by email at <R-conferences@r-project.org>.

The R Foundation has a [policy](/coc-policy.html) requiring a [code of conduct](/coc.html) at R conferences.

## useR! --- International R User Conference

![useR logo](useR.png)\

The [**useR! 2025**](https://user2025.r-project.org) conference will take place at Duke University, in Durham, NC, USA, August 8-10. 

For regular updates follow [useR_conf@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@useR_conf) on Mastodon, [user-conf](https://www.linkedin.com/company/user-conf/) on LinkedIn, or [user-conf](https://bsky.app/profile/user-conf.bsky.social) on Bluesky.

<!-- We are not currently seeking hosts or organizers for future useR! conferences. -->
<!--**A [call for proposals](useR_2023_call.html) is open to host a hybrid useR! conference in 2023 or 2024**. Deadline for outline proposals: **Wednesday 30 November 2022**.-->

Calls for proposals to organize useR! will be announced on this page, and the R Foundation social media accounts: [R_Foundation@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@R_Foundation) on Mastodon, [the-r-foundation-for-statistical-computing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-r-foundation-for-statistical-computing/) on LinkedIn, and [r-foundation](https://bsky.app/profile/r-foundation.bsky.social) on Bluesky. 

Major announcements regarding useR! (e.g. call for abstracts, call for proposals to host useR!) are also made on the low-volume [R-Announce mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce) (posts to R-Announce go to the [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help) as well).

useR! is the main meeting of the R user and developer community, its program consists of both invited and user-contributed presentations:

-   The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from technical and R-related computing issues to general statistical topics of current interest.
-   The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually) any R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized in sessions of regular talks, lightning talks, and poster presentations.
-   The RFCC welcomes expressions of interest from potential local organisers. Groups thinking about hosting a useR! conference are welcome to contact the RFCC by email at <R-conferences@r-project.org>.

Usually, no proceedings are published for useR! conferences, though slides and videos are often available on the conference websites. From 2022, videos can be found on the [useR! YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/useRConference_global).

The [useR! Knowledgebase](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/main/) provides a guide for anyone involved in organizing useR!, while the [useR! Infoboard](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userinfoboard/) provides data on past useR! conferences. These resources are maintained by useR! organizers past and present.

## DSC --- Directions in Statistical Computing

![DSC logo](dsc.png)\

DSC is a conference for the developers of statistical software and researchers in statistical computing which is somewhat focused on but not exclusively devoted to R. It aims at providing a platform for exchanging ideas about developments in statistical computing (rather than \`only' the usage of statistical software for applications).

DSC has had two different incarnations. The first was a biennial conference series from 1999 to 2009 with open registration, an open call for papers and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. After a 5 year hiatus, DSC resumed in 2014 as an annual conference coinciding with the General Assembly of the R Foundation. For 2020, speakers will be invited, but there will be open registration.

### Events in under-supported regions
