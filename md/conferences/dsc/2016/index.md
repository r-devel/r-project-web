# Overview

Directions in Statistical Computing (DSC) 2016 was an
invitation-only conference held at Stanford University July 1-2. The
major themes were language design/implementation and distributed
computing. Morning talks were followed by self-organizing groups and
a general assembly of the R Foundation both afternoons.
