title: Call for Proposals to Host the Global Online useR! 2023 Conference
--- 

The R Foundation Conference Committee (RFCC) invites proposals to host the useR! 2023 conference in an online format. The call for proposals is open to teams of R community members based anywhere in the world. It is expected that the core team will be connected in some way, for example representing a geographical region or community organization. Additional team members may be added at a later stage for global representation.

The useR! conferences are the main meetings for the R user and developer community. There are two main aspects of useR! conferences: 

1. An emphasis on innovative contributions. As such, we require all proposals to have substantial involvement from academic partners and to be led by members of the R community.
2. Having diversity and inclusion at its heart. For that reason, we ask for proposals to put diversity and inclusion practices explicitly at the core of the conference design. 

useR! 2021 was the first R conference that was global by design, both in audience and leadership. Leveraging a diversity of experiences and backgrounds helped to make the conference accessible and inclusive in as many ways as possible and to grow the global community of R users giving new talents access to this amazing ecosystem. **We want to build on this positive experience for useR! 2023.**

## Key dates for the proposal process

Interested parties are asked to submit an outline proposal. Based on these proposals, the R Foundation Conference Committee will select a short-list of teams, who will be invited to a second round interview. The key dates are as follows: 

| Event | Date |
| ----- | ---- |
| Teams submit outline proposal | Friday 22 April 2022 |
| RFCC select short-list | Friday 13 May 2022 |
| Online interview (short-listed teams) &nbsp;  | May 30 - June 3 2022 |

<br>
Further details are given below. Please submit your outline proposal to <R-conferences@r-project.org> by **Friday 22 April 2022**.

## Essential functions of an organizing team

The organizing team are responsible for:

* Establishing the **conference program**.
* Selecting a **program committee and keynote speakers** in agreement with the R Foundation Conference Committee (RFCC). 
* Maintaining the **conference website**.
* Managing **conference registration, abstract and tutorial submission**.
* Managing the **online platform(s)** for the conference.
* **Advertising the conference** via social media, local societies, etc.
* **Obtaining sponsorship** for the conference and providing promotional opportunities for sponsors, e.g. via conference booths.
* Ensuring that there is a trained **code of conduct** team to enforce the code of conduct.
* Publishing a [**diversity statement**](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/diversity-equity-and-inclusion.html#diversity-statement) and [**accessibility guidelines**](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/accessibility/) for presenters on the conference website.
* **Organizing social activities** during the conference (online social gatherings).

We recommend that the organizers read the [useR! Knowledgebase](https://bit.ly/knowledgebase-cfp), which provides useful information on organizing a useR! conference. This resource is still under development and information is subject to change.

## Outline Proposal

The outline proposal should give an overview of the team's plans for useR! 2023 in no more than 4 pages.

**The proposal** should take the format of useR! 2021/2022 as a guide, anticipating around 1500 attendees. Teams are welcome to share any ideas they have for new initiatives.

The proposal should include:
    
1. An overview of the **organizing team**: 
    * Who are the people leading the bid? 
    * What is their scientific/technical background, their career stages? 
    * Which universities/businesses/R-communities/organizations are represented? 
    * Do you have any experience hosting online events?
    * Have you worked together before?
    * We suggest to take a look at the areas of responsibility in the [useR! knowledgebase (Roles and Responsibilities section)](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/conference-overview.html): would the team have people for each of these areas?
2. Initial **ideas for the program**: do you have ideas for keynote speakers or themes? 
3. (Optional) Ideas for co-ordinated in-person events, such as locally organized watch-parties or satellite workshops.
3. **Key dates**: when would the conference potentially take place? The dates should avoid major statistical computing meetings and major international holidays.
4. **General pitch**: what are the main reasons to select your proposal, are there other factors that support your bid?

Remember - **the following aspects are required: **

  - Involvement of academic institutions and R community members in the organizing team
  - Taking into account diversity and inclusion practices in all spaces of the organization: the organizing team, venue/platforms, ideas for keynotes, budget, and others

## Interview

Short-listed teams will be given feedback on their proposal and invited to a call with representatives of the RFCC and key organizers of useR! since it moved online. The call will give the opportunity to discuss any issues raised in the feedback, along with further issues that the selected team will need to address.

During the interview, teams may be asked about:

* **More detailed plans** for the conference :
    * How do you plan to accommodate time zones?  
    * Which online tools would you potentially use? Do they need much bandwidth? Are they screen-reader friendly? 
* **Platforms** for registration/submission: any thoughts on the platforms to use for registration and abstract submission (would they be screen-reader friendly)?
* **Approximate budget**: what costs are roughly expected for basic audio-visual requirements (including  captioning), code of conduct training, or others? Do you have potential sponsors in mind?
* **Draft timeline** for organizing the conference. (See example in the [knowledgebase](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/conference-overview.html#key-dates-for-planning))
* **Financial and legal support**: Is there an institution (university, association, ...) that can handle finances and provide legal support?
* **Plans to widen participation**.

## Relationship with the R Foundation Conference Committee (RFCC)

* **Before submission**: The members of the RFCC can be contacted for questions regarding the proposal or selection process: <R-conferences@R-project.org>.

* **After selection**: The organizing team is responsible for the day-to-day organization. They should maintain regular contact with the RFCC, to keep them informed of progress, particularly regarding the conference program. The RFCC will provide input regarding the selection of the program committee and keynote speakers, giving the final approval for both. They will nominate a delegate to represent them in the organizing team if there is no member of the R Foundation on the team already. 

* The RFCC can provide support by **sharing knowledge and materials** from previous years, though most of it is already in the [useR! Knowledgebase](https://bit.ly/knowledgebase-cfp) and [Infoboard](https://bit.ly/infoboard-cfp). The organizers should update the [knowledgebase](https://rconf.gitlab.io/userknowledgebase/contributions.html#how-to-contribute-to-this-knowledgebase), [infoboard](https://gitlab.com/rconf/userinfoboard/) and the [central useR! organization repository](https://gitlab.com/rconf/userorganization), sharing their experience and material to help future organizers. 

* The R Foundation grants organizers the right to use the useR! branding. They will encourage R Foundation members to attend the meeting and advertise the meeting on the R project website and the R Foundation social media accounts. The useR! conference not only provides an event for the R community but also a source of income for the R Foundation. Therefore the organizing team is expected to share a reasonable proportion of the profits from the conference with the R Foundation.

## Relationship with R Core

The useR! conference has a unique opportunity to benefit from contributions from R Core members. One keynote slot is reserved for an R Core speaker and R Core will liaise with the conference organizers regarding other ways that R Core can contribute to the meeting.
