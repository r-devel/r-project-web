title: Donate to the R Foundation
---

If you want to donate money to the R Foundation, please fill out the [donation form](donation-form.pdf) and return it by fax or mail. All donors will be listed on the R project homepage and in one issue of [R News](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/) per year (unless the respective donor prefers otherwise).

##### Notes for non-Europeans

-   USA: The R Foundation is not registered as a charitable organisation in the USA. We are looking at becoming registered as a foreign 501(c)3 non-profit organisation. This would still not make personal donations to R Foundation tax-deductible, but would make it easier for US non-profit organisations to donate.
