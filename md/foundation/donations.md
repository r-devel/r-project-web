There are two ways to give money to the R Foundation.  You can either become
a supporting member of the R foundation with an annual donation of &euro;

If you have questions, please contact <treasurer@R-project.org>. Like all
activities of the R Foundation, donations are managed by volonteers and
the list of donors is typically updated once or twice per month.
