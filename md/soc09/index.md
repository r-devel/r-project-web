# Projects 2009

The R Foundation for Statistical Computing is participating in [Google Summer of Code 2009](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/rf). Based on the [ideas list](ideas.html) the following projects and students are selected and are sponsored by Google during summer 2008 (sorted alphabetically by student):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation of the CRUISE algorithm

*by Eva Hoermann, mentored by Torsten Hothorn.*

The aim of the project is the implementation of recursive partitioning methods ("trees") which aren't available in R at the moment. The student can choose a method to begin with from a larger set of interesting algorithms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## cranlab -- "You can't control what you can't measure"

*by Mariane Machado, mentored by Manuel J. A. Eugster.*

The aim of this project is the (1) implementation of software metrics to analyze R packages and (2) the creation of a CRAN software metrics monitor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Development of crantastic.org

*by Bjorn Arild Maeland, mentored by Hadley Wickham.*

Create an information portal for the fast growing list of R packages, integrating package documentation and journal publications with feedback from the useR community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RQuantLib - Bridging R and QuantLib

*by Khanh Nguyen, mentored by Dirk Eddelbuettel.*

The goal of this Summer of Code project is to (1.) extend the coverage of QuantLib code available to R by adding more wrapper functions to RQuantLib, and to (2.) provide additional functionality to QuantLib by leveraging the numerous statistical facilities in R -- this could be anything from standard to robust estimation methods, data visualization or report creation via tools like Sweave.
