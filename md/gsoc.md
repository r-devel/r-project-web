title: Google Summer of Code
---

The R Project has been participating as a [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4947241283354624/)
(GSoC) organization since 2008. The current administrators of GSoC-R
are Toby Dylan Hocking, Brian Peterson, and Virgilio Gomez Rubio as a
backup.

We are grateful to the students, mentors and administrators, whose work
also raises money for the R Foundation.

Further information can be found on the GSoC-R pages hosted on
