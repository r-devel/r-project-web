title: Google Summer of Code
---

The R project has been participating as a [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4947241283354624/)
(GSoC) organization since 2008. The current administrators of GSoC-R
are Toby Dylan Hocking, Brian Peterson, and Virgilio Gomez Rubio as a
backup.

There were 33 GSoC-R projects in 2017. We are grateful to the
students, mentors and administrators, whose work also raises money for
The R Foundation.

Further information can be found on the GSoC-R pages hosted on
