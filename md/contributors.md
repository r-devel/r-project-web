The current R is the result of a collaborative effort with contributions
from all over the world. R was initially written by Robert Gentleman and
Ross Ihaka—also known as "*R & R*" of the Statistics Department of the
University of Auckland. Since mid-1997 there has been a core group,
the *R Core Team*, with
write access to the R source, currently consisting of

Many more, too numerous to mention here, have contributed by sending bug
reports and suggesting various improvements.

Simon Davies whilst at the University of Auckland wrote the original
version of glm().

Julian Harris and Wing Kwong (Tiki) Wan whilst at the University of
Auckland assisted Ross Ihaka with the original Macintosh port.

R was inspired by the S environment which has been principally
developed by John Chambers, with substantial input from Douglas Bates,
Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland, Trevor Hastie, Daryl Pregibon and
Allan Wilks.

A special debt is owed to John Chambers who has graciously contributed
advice and encouragement in the early days of R and later became a
member of the core team.

Stefano Iacus (a former member of R Core) and Simon Urbanek developed
the macOS port, including the R.app GUI, toolchains and packaging.

The Windows port was developed by Guido Masarotto (for a while a
member of R Core) and Brian Ripley, then Duncan Murdoch (a former
member of R Core) and currently by Jeroen Ooms (base) and Uwe Ligges
(packages).

Tomas Kalibera's work has been sponsored by Jan Vitek and funded by
his European Research Council grant "Evolving Language Ecosystems
(ELE)".

Computing support (including hardware, hosting and infrastructure) has
been provided/funded by the R Foundation, employers of R-Core members
(notably WU Wien, ETH Zurich, U Oxford and U Iowa) and by Northeastern
University and the University of Kent.

Distributions of R contain the recommended packages, whose
authors/contributors are listed in their DESCRIPTION files.
