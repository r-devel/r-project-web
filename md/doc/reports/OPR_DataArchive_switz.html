<h2 class="first">Switzerland Socio-Economic Variables, 1870-1930</h2>

<h3>History of the Data</h3> <p>Francine Vanderwalle compiled
socio-economic data for Switzerland for the census years 1870, 1888,
1910 and 1930.  The data are contained in separate data files; some
variables are available at only one point in time, while others exist
for all years.  The main source for the data was <em>Statistique de
la Suisse.</em> The data are aggregated by canton and district, with
a label to identify the canton and district.  These internal labels,
unfortunately were different for each year.  The total number of
districts was 181 in 1870. In 1888, one new district was added in
Canton 15 (App Ar), bringing the total to  182.  In 1910, 5 new
districts were added in Canton 11 (Solothurn), bringing the total to
187.  In 1930, four districts were dropped: one in Canton 12 (Basel);
one in Canton 17 (St. Gall); and two in Canton 25 (Geneve),
reducing the total to 183.  Variables may not be comparable in these
districts in the affected years.</p>

<p>In 1983, Susan Watkins and Beverly Harris converted the data into
ascii format, put it on tape, and created codebooks for the data, as
well as a list of
<a href="efswvars.aspx">common variables</a> (<em>no longer available since 2025!</em>)
and a key to match the labels in
the data to the cantons and districts.  They also contacted Francine
Vanderwalle for clarification of the meanings of some variables.  All
of the documentation was added to the tape along with the data.
Beverly Harris passed along a folder of notes to Barbara Vaughan when
she left OPR.  </p>

<p>In 1994, Barbara Vaughan moved the data from tape to the OPR Unix
archive.  She noticed a major problem with the key to identify the
cantons and districts: Two of the years (1870 and 1930) seemed to
have district labels that were not unique.  After examining the data,
she determined that in 1930, the internal labels in the data were
unique, but did not match the key in the documentation.  Fortunately,
all four data files had a series of variables that were supposed to
be identical (the years that Ig and infant mortality reached certain
levels).  Using the two years that did have accurately described and
unique labels, she attached these variables to the key and then
matched the other two years to these variables in order to determine
the canton and district.  To avoid the need to use the printed key at
all, she added a unique 4-digit label (taken from the key listing),
as well as the name of the canton and district, to the end of the
data records.</p>

<p>Some editing of the codebooks was also done at this time; for
instance, the altitude variables were previously labelled as "feet"
although Francine Vanderwalle's notes indicated that they were
metres.  Also, there were some obvious errors in the list of canton and
district names, which were corrected from Francine's notes.</p>

<h3>Contents of the Data</h3>

<p>The four indices of fertility (If, Ig, Ih, and Im) are available
for all four years, as well as infant mortality and the proportion of
women single at age 20-24 and age 45-49.  Proportions belonging to
major language groups and religions are available for all years.
Variables measuring the education level of draftees are available
through 1910, as are the proportions living at various altitudes,
which was found to be correlated to fertility trends.  Most years have
comparable variables showing the breakdown of the labor force by
sector, and female labor force participation.  The 1910 data set has
variables obtained from a special 1905 "census of enterprises".</p>

<p>All of the variables (except those added by Barbara Vaughan) are
in 10-column fields with three decimals.  The terms "proportion" and
"per cent" are used rather loosely in the codebooks.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
<ul>

<li>The variables that should be identical for all four years (the
years that infant mortality rate and marital fertility fall to
certain levels) are in fact sometimes different for some districts in
some years.  In most cases, this appears to be because of a redrawing
of districts within a canton.  This should perhaps make researchers
wary of comparing other variables in the affected cantons and years.
</li>

<li>The district labelled "Toggnbrg, Alt" in St. Gall (Canton 17) in
1930 may in fact be "Tablat".  According to the documentation,
"Toggnbrg, Alt" was dropped in 1930.  However, because of other
errors in the documentation for 1930, the districts were
matched based on the variables that were the same for all
four years.  There was no match for Tablat, although there was a
match for "Toggnbrg, Alt". </li>

<li>Labor force participation statistics for 1870 and 1888 are based
on statistics of the proportion employed in "agriculture", "industry"
and "administration, commerce and transportation"; in 1910 and 1930,
these are the proportions employed in primary, secondary and tertiary
industries.</li>

<li>According to Francine Vanderwalle's notes, all birth and
mortality statistics include stillbirths.</li>

<li>Draftees are all 18-year-old men.</li>
</ul>
