# Overview

Directions in Statistical Computing (DSC) 2017 was an invitation-only
conference held in conjunction with UseR! 2017 in Brussels, July
3-4. Talks covered a diverse range of topics revolving around R,
including parallel/distributed computing, compilation, syntax
extensions, alternative implementations of basic vectors, and
package management. There was an R-core meeting on the afternoon of
July 3, where some of the proposals were discussed.
