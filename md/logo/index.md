The R logo is &copy; 2016 The R Foundation. 

You can distribute the logo under the terms of the [Creative Commons

It is available in raster and vector formats:

* [SVG](Rlogo.svg) (2 KB)

The __CC-BY-SA 4.0__ license allows you to share and adapt the logo for
any purpose, including commercial use, provided that you give
appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if any
changes were made. It is also [one-way
compatible](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3)
with the [GNU General Public License version
3](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-3) (GPL&#8209;3). However,
CC-BY-SA 4.0 is not compatible with GPL&#8209;2. If you wish to incorporate
the logo into works licensed under __GPL-2__ then you must use the GPL-2
license for the logo.

Note that [special
considerations](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3#Considerations_for_adapters_applying_the_GPLv3)
apply when using the GPL-2 license for the logo or when incorporating
it into works licensed under GPL-3 . In particular, the GPL includes
the concept of *source*, which is defined as "the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it". We consider the
vector version of the R logo in SVG format to be the source by this definition.
