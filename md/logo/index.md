The CC-BY-SA 4.0 license allows you to share and adapt the logo for
any purpose, including commercial use, provided that you give
appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if any
changes were made. It is also [one-way
compatible](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3)
with the [GNU General Public License version

CC-BY-SA 4.0 is not compatible with GPL-2. If you wish to incorporate
the logo into works licensed under GPL-2 then you must use the GPL-2
license for the logo.

Note that [special
considerations](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3#Considerations_for_adapters_applying_the_GPLv3)
apply when using the GPL-2 license for the logo or when incorporating
it into works licensed under GPL-3 . In particular, the GPL includes
the concept of *source*, which is defined as "the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it". We consider the
high-resolution version of the R logo in PNG format (INSERT DIMENSIONS
HERE) to be the source by this definition.
