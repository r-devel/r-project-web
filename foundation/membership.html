<h2>R Foundation Membership</h2>

The R foundation consists of ordinary and supporting
members:
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Ordinary members</strong>
  <dd>are elected by a majority vote of the general assembly. New
    ordinary members are selected based on their non-monetary
    contributions (code, effort, ...) to the R project. The
    initial set of ordinary members at establishment of the organization
    consists of the members of the "R Development Core Team" as
    listed in the sources of R release 1.5.0.
  <dt><strong>Supporting Members</strong>
  <dd>Any person or legal entity may become a supporting member.  Supporting
    members promote the organization primarily by paying membership
    fees.
