<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a  name="intro"></a>

The R Foundation is a non-profit organization working in
the public interest. It has been founded by the members of the R Core
Development Team in order to
<ul>
  <li>Advance the R project for statistical computing to provide a
    free and open source software environment for data analysis and
    graphics.</li>
  <li>Act as an official voice for the R project, providing means of
  communication with the press, commercial and noncommercial
  organizations interested in R.</li>
  <li>Hold and administer the copyright of R software and
  documentation.</li>
</ul>

R is an official part of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
Foundation</a>'s GNU project, and the R Foundation has similar goals
to other open source software foundations like the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation" >Apache Foundation</a> or the
<a href="http://foundation.gnome.org" >GNOME Foundation</a>: provide
organizational and financial support for developers and users.
