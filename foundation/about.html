The R Foundation is a not for profit organization working in
the public interest. It has been founded by the members of the R
Development Core Team in order to
<ul>
  <li>
  Provide support for the R project and other innovations in statistical 
  computing. We believe that R has become a mature and valuable tool
  and we would like to ensure its continued development and the
  development of future innovations in software for statistical and
  computational research.
  <li>Provide a reference point for individuals,
  instititutions or commercial enterprises that want to support or interact
  with the R development community.
  <li>Hold and administer the copyright of R software and
  documentation.</li>
</ul>

R is an official part of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
Foundation</a>'s GNU project, and the R Foundation has similar goals
to other open source software foundations like the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation" >Apache Foundation</a> or the
<a href="http://foundation.gnome.org" >GNOME Foundation</a>.

<p>
Among the goals of the R Foundation are the support of continued
development of R, the exploration of new methodology, teaching and
training of statistical computing and the organization of meetings and
conferences with a statistical computing orientation. We hope to
attract sufficient funding to make these goals realities.
