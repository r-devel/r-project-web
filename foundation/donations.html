<h2>Donations to the R Foundation</h2>

If you want to donate money to the R Foundation, please fill out the
<a href="donation-form.pdf" >donation form</a> and return it by fax or
mail. All donors will be listed on the R project homepage and in one
issue of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/" >R News</a>
per year (unless the respective donor prefers otherwise).<p>


<h5> Notes for non-Europeans</h5>
<ul>
<li> USA:  The R Foundation is not registered as 
a charitable organisation in 
the USA. We are looking at becoming registered as a foreign 501(c)3 
non-profit organisation. This would still not make personal donations to 
R Foundation tax-deductible, but would make it easier for US non-profit 
organisations to donate.
