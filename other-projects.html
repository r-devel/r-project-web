    target="_top">Bioconductor</a>: Bioinformatics with R</strong>
  <dd>The broad goals of Bioconductor are to
    <ul>
      <li>
      provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and
      graphical methods
      for the analysis of genomic data;</li>
      
      <li>
      facilitate the integration of biological metadata in the
      analysis of experimental data: e.g. literature data from PubMed,
      annotation data from LocusLink;</li>
      
      <li> allow the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and
      interoperable software;</li>

      <li>promote high-quality and reproducible
      research; </li>

      <li>
      provide training in computational and statistical methods for
      the analysis of genomic data.</li>
    </ul>

  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.omegahat.org" target="_top">Omega</a>:
    Distributed Statistical Computing</strong>
    
  <dd>Omega is a joint project with the goal of providing a variety of
    open-source software for statistical applications. The Omega project
    began with discussions among designers responsible for
    three current statistical languages (S, R, and Lisp-Stat), with the
    idea of working together on new directions with special emphasis on
    web-based software, Java, the Java virtual machine, and distributed
    computing. Omega encourages participation by anyone wanting to extend
    computing capabilities in one of the existing languages, to those
    interested in distributed or web-based statistical software, and to
    those interested in the design of new statistical languages.

    Graphical User Interfaces for R</strong>
  <dd>This web page gives an overview over several projects that
    develop or offer
    the opportunity to develop
    graphical user interfaces for R.  A Special Interest Group mailing
    list (R-SIG-GUI) exists also to freely discuss concerned issues.

      Spatial Statistics with R</strong>
    <dd>This collection of web pages is intended to be a guide to some
      of the resources for the analysis of spatial data using R, and
      other associated software.

    gRaphical models in R</strong>

    <dd>Graphical models have now been around for a long time and have shown
      to have a wide range of potential applications, but
      software for graphical models is currently only available in a large
      number of specialised packages.
      The time has come to integrate such facilities in general
      software, such
      as R, with flexible extension and modification of prepackaged modules.
