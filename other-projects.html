  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.omegahat.org" target="_top">Omega</a>:
    Distributed Statistical Computing</strong>
    
  <dd>Omega is a joint project with the goal of providing a variety of
    open-source software for statistical applications. The Omega project
    began with discussions among designers responsible for
    three current statistical languages (S, R, and Lisp-Stat), with the
    idea of working together on new directions with special emphasis on
    web-based software, Java, the Java virtual machine, and distributed
    computing. Omega encourages participation by anyone wanting to extend
    computing capabilities in one of the existing languages, to those
    interested in distributed or web-based statistical software, and to
    those interested in the design of new statistical languages.
