<h2>Special Areas of Application</h2>

Projects focusing on a special application areas, statistical models, etc.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>
    <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org"
    target="_top">Bioconductor</a>: Bioinformatics with R</strong>
  <dd>The broad goals of Bioconductor are to
    <ul>
      <li>
      provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and
      graphical methods
      for the analysis of genomic data;</li>
      
      <li>
      facilitate the integration of biological metadata in the
      analysis of experimental data: e.g. literature data from PubMed,
      annotation data from LocusLink;</li>
      
      <li> allow the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and
      interoperable software;</li>

      <li>promote high-quality and reproducible
      research; </li>

      <li>
      provide training in computational and statistical methods for
      the analysis of genomic data.</li>
    </ul>

    >
    Microarray Software Comparison</a></strong>
  <dd>
    A website organizing and commenting on links to R software for
    gene expression data analysis, including software not available from
    Bioconductor or CRAN.

    <dt><strong><a href="http://www.R-project.org/Rgeo"
      target="_top">Rgeo</a>:
      Spatial Statistics with R</strong>
    <dd>This collection of web pages is intended to be a guide to some
      of the resources for the analysis of spatial data using R, and
      other associated software.
    
    <p>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.R-project.org/gR" target="_top">gR</a>:
    gRaphical models in R</strong>
  <dd>
    gR is an initiative aiming at providing facilities for graphical
    models in R. It includes software for graphical model fitting, graph
    visualizations and computations, and interfaces to standalone
    graphical model software packages such as BUGS, CoCo and MIM.

    <p>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.Rmetrics.org"
    target="_top">Rmetrics</a>: Financial Market Analysis with R</strong>
  <dd>Rmetrics is an open source solution for financial market
    analysis and valuation of financial instruments.<p>

      <dt><strong><a href="http://www.luc.ac.be/~jlindsey/rcode.html" target="_top">
    Jim Lindsey's R page</a></strong>
  <dd> contains code for nonlinear regression
    and repeated measurements (packages event, gnlm, growth,
    repeated, rmutil and stable).

<h2>Computational Infrastructure</h2>

Projects focusing on computational infrastructure, user interfaces,
web-based services, etc.

<dl>
    <p>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.omegahat.org" target="_top">Omega</a>:
    Distributed Statistical Computing</strong>
    
  <dd>Omega is a joint project with the goal of providing a variety of
    open-source software for statistical applications. The Omega project
    began with discussions among designers responsible for
    three current statistical languages (S, R, and Lisp-Stat), with the
    idea of working together on new directions with special emphasis on
    web-based software, Java, the Java virtual machine, and distributed
    computing. Omega encourages participation by anyone wanting to extend
    computing capabilities in one of the existing languages, to those
    interested in distributed or web-based statistical software, and to
    those interested in the design of new statistical languages.

    <p>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.R-project.org/GUI" target="_top">R GUIs</a>:
    Graphical User Interfaces for R</strong>
  <dd>This web page gives an overview over several projects that
    develop or offer
    the opportunity to develop
    graphical user interfaces for R.  A Special Interest Group mailing
    list (R-SIG-GUI) exists also to freely discuss concerned issues. 

    <p>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://ess.R-project.org/"
    target="_top">ESS</a>:
    Emacs speaks Statistics</strong>
  <dd>An
    Emacs-Lisp interface to interactive statistical programming and data
    analysis languages, including: S dialects (such as R), LispStat
    dialects and SAS.<p>

    <dd>Tools for integrating R and Zope for developing WWW-based
      statistical environments. These include RSOAP (simple API for
      managing and communicating with multiple concurrent R
      processes), RSessionDA (Zope objects for interacting with R), and
      others.
