<h1 align=left>The R Project for Statistical Computing</h1>

<p>
R is `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was
developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a
wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...).

<p>
R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked
and called at run time.
