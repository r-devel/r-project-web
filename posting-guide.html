<h1>Posting Guide: How to ask good questions that prompt useful answers</h1>

This guide is intended to help you get the most out of the R
mailing lists, and to avoid embarrassment.  Like many responses
posted on the list, it is written in a concise manner.  This
is not intended to be unfriendly - it is more a consequence
of allocating the limited available time and space to technical issues
rather than to social niceties.

<p><b>The list:</b> Remember that R is free software, constructed
  and maintained by volunteers.  They have various reasons for
  contributing software and participating on the mailing lists, but often
  have limited time.

<p><b>Good manners:</b> Remember that customs differ.  Some people
  are very direct.  Others surround everything they say with
  hedges and apologies.  Be tolerant.  Rudeness is never warranted,
  but sometimes `read the manual' <em>is</em> the appropriate response.
  Don't waste time discussing such matters on the list.
  Ad hominem comments are absolutely out of place.

<p><b>Questions about statistics:</b> The R mailing lists are
  primarily intended for questions and discussion about the R
  software.  However, questions about statistical
  methodology are sometimes posted.  If the question is
  well-asked and of interest to someone on the list, it
  <em>may</em> elicit an informative up-to-date answer.
  See also the Usenet groups sci.stat.consult (applied
  statistics and consulting) and sci.stat.math
  (mathematical stat and probability).

<p><b>Basic statistics and classroom homework:</b>
  R-help is not intended for these.

<p><a name="which_list"><b>Which list: R-help, R-devel, or Bioconductor?</b></a>
  There are two widely used mailing lists for questions and discussion about
  R and a list dedicated more specifically to issues in the use of
  bioconductor packages and bioinformatics.<br>
  <b>R-help</b> is intended to be comprehensible to people who
   want to use R to solve problems but who are not necessarily
   interested in or knowledgeable about programming.
  <b>R-devel</b> is intended for questions
   and discussion about code development in R.  Questions likely to
   prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers should go to
   to R-devel.  For example, questions involving C, C++,
   etc. code should go to R-devel.
   More general questions involving pure R code and questions
   likely to be of interest to the large and diverse set of
   subscribers to R-help should go to R-help.<br>
  <b>Bioconductor</b> is for announcements about the development of <a
  HREF="http://www.bioconductor.org/"> Bioconductor </a>, availability of
  new code, questions and answers about problems and solutions using
  Bioconductor, etc. See <a
  HREF="http://www.bioconductor.org/mailList.html"> Bioconductor mailing
  lists</a> for details.
  See <a href="#contrib_pkgs">below</a> for questions on <em>contributed
  packages</em>.

<p><a name="platform_specific"><b>Platform-specific questions</b>:
    There are lists <b>R-sig-Mac</b>, <b>R-sig-Debian</b>
    and <b>R-sig-Fedora</b> for R on Mac OS X, Debian/Ubuntu and
    Fedora/Redhat respectively.  Questions specific to those platforms
    (especially <em>re</em> installation and the <b>R.app</b> GUI on
    Mac OS X) are more likely to get informed responses on the
    appropriate list, and that is certainly the place to discuss
    possible bugs.

<p><b>Do your homework before posting:</b> If it is clear
 that you have done basic background research, you are far
 more likely to get an informative response.  See also <a
 href="#further">Further Resources</a> further down this page.

<ul>
<li>Do <code>help.search("keyword")</code> and
       <code>apropos("keyword")</code> with
different keywords (type this at the R prompt).

<li>Do <code>RSiteSearch("keyword")</code> with different keywords (at the
R prompt) to search R functions, contributed packages and R-Help
postings. See <code>?RSiteSearch</code> for further options and to restrict
searches.

<li>Read the online help for relevant functions (type
<code>?functionname</code>, e.g., <code>?prod</code>, at the
R prompt)

<li>If something seems to have changed in R, look in the latest <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/NEWS">NEWS</a> file on CRAN for
information about it.

<li>Search the R-faq and the R-windows-faq if it might be relevant (<a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html">http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html</a>)

<li>Read at least the relevant section in <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">An Introduction
to R</a>

<li>If the function is from a package accompanying a
book, e.g., the MASS package, consult the
book before posting

<li>The R Wiki has a <a
href="http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=getting-started:reference-cards:getting-help">section
on finding functions and documentation</a>

</ul>

<b>Technical details of posting</b>: See <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/mail.html#instructions">General Instructions</a>
for more  details of the following:
<ul>
  <li>No HTML posting (harder to detect spam) (note that this is the
  default in some mail clients - you may have to turn it off).  Note that
  chances have become relatively high for 'HTMLified' e-mails to be
  completely intercepted (without notice to the sender).
  <li>No binary attachments except for PS, PDF, and some image and archive
  formats (others are automatically stripped off because they can contain
  malicious software). Files in other formats and larger ones should rather
  be put on the web and have only their URLs posted.  This way a
  reader has the option to download them or not.
  <li>Use an informative subject line (not something like `question')
  <li>For new subjects, compose a new message and include the
  'r-help@R-project.org' (or 'r-devel@R-project.org') address
  specifically. (Replying to an existing post and then changing the subject
  messes up the threading in the archives and in many people's mail readers.)
  <li>If you can't send from an email address that simply accepts replies,
  then say so in your posting so that people are not inconvenienced when
  they try to respond to your message
  <li>Some consider it good manners to include a concise signature
  specifying affiliation
</ul>

<p><b>Surprising behavior and bugs:</b> What you think is a
  bug may be many other things,
  such as a default behavior that you do not like, a feature, an
  undocumented feature, or a bug in the documentation.  You do
  not need to commit yourself to one of these in order to ask a
  question.  If it is a real bug, someone will notice it.
  Before you post a real bug
  report, make sure you read <a
href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-Bugs">R
Bugs</a> in the R-faq.  If you're not completely and utterly
sure
  something is a bug, post a question to r-help, not a bug
  report to r-bugs - every bug report requires manual
action by one of the R-core members.
  Also, see Simon Tatham's essay on <a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How
to Report Bugs Effectively</a>.

<p>For questions about unexpected behavior or a possible
bug, you should, at a minimum, copy and paste the output
from <code>sessionInfo()</code> into your message.  When
mentioning version numbers, always use the full version
number, e.g., `2.6.1', not just `2.6', and also mention the
platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, with their versions).  Other
potentially relevant details include the locale (type
<code>Sys.getlocale()</code> at the R prompt), and whether
you installed a pre-compiled binary version of R or compiled
it yourself.  If the function is in a package other than
`base', include the header output from
<code>library(help=thatPackage)</code>.  If you are using an
old version of R and think it does not work properly,
upgrade to the latest version and try that, before posting.
If possible, try the current R-patched or R-devel version of
R (see the FAQ for details), to see if the problem has
already been addressed.

<p>For questions about functions in standard packages
distributed with R (see the FAQ <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Add-on-packages-in-R">
Add-on packages in R</a>), ask questions on R-help.  <br>
If the question relates to a <em><a name="contrib_pkgs">contributed package</a>
</em>, e.g., one downloaded from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer
first.  You can also use <code>find("functionname")</code> and
<code>packageDescription("packagename")</code> to find this
information. <b>Only</b> send such questions to R-help
or R-devel if you get no reply or need further assistance.  This
applies to both requests for help and to bug reports.

<p>Don't say <em>`R crashed'</em>, which you may take to mean that R
gave an error and terminated your piece of code, but most
people will take to mean abnormal termination of the R
program.  Say exactly what happened, including any error
messages you received.

<p><b>Examples:</b> Sometimes it helps to provide a <em>small</em>
 example that someone can actually run.  For example:

<pre>
  If I have a matrix x as follows:
  &gt; x &lt;- matrix(1:8, nrow=4, ncol=2,
                dimnames=list(c("A","B","C","D"), c("x","y"))
  &gt; x
    x y
  A 1 5
  B 2 6
  C 3 7
  D 4 8
  &gt;

  how can I turn it into a dataframe with 8 rows, and three
  columns named `row', `col', and `value', which have the
  dimension names as the values of `row' and `col', like this:
  &gt; x.df
     row col value
  1    A   x      1
   ...
  (To which the answer might be:
  &gt; x.df &lt;- reshape(data.frame(row=rownames(x), x), direction="long",
                    varying=list(colnames(x)), times=colnames(x),
                    v.names="value", timevar="col", idvar="row")
  )
</pre>

When providing examples, it is best to give an R command
that constructs the data, as in the <code>matrix()</code>
expression above.  For more complicated data structures,
<code>dump("x", file=stdout())</code> will print an
expression that will recreate the object <code>x</code>.

<p><a name="further"><b>Further resources:</b></a> not
always consulting these before posting is OK, except perhaps
if you have a very general question and the topic of the
document indicates immediate relevancy.  A response
might just point you towards one of these.

<ul>
  <li><a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">Writing
R Extensions</a> covers packages, to and from C &amp; C++, R
help files.

  <li><a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.pdf">R
Data Import/Export</a> covers reading from and exporting to other
file formats

  <li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.pdf">R Language
  Definition</a> (aka `R Language Manual') describes the R language, data
  objects, etc.  This document specifies many details of R
  that are not covered in the help pages or in "An
  Introduction to R".

  <li>The article `R Help Desk' by Uwe Ligges in the
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2003-1.pdf">R
Newsletter Vol 3 No 1</a> has useful tips about where to find
information about R.

<li>Two books are often cited in answers to questions: <a
href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS4">Venables &amp;
Ripley, 2002, Modern Applied Statistics with S (4th ed)</a>
("MASS") and <a
href="http://nlme.stat.wisc.edu/MEMSS">Pinheiro &amp; Bates,
2000</a> (about lme in particular).  If you can get these
books, look at them.  If you cannot, you might indicate this
in your question.  Further books relevant to R are listed at
<a
href="http://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-publications.html">Publications</a>.

<li>The <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html">Contributed
Documentation</a> page lists a number of useful introductory
and other documents available online.

<li>The R-help archives (see under `Archives
  and Search Facilities' at <a
  href="http://www.r-project.org/mail.html">http://www.r-project.org/mail.html</a>)

<li>The <a href="http://wiki.r-project.org/">R-Wiki</a> contains
 documentation about R contributed by the R community, and Paul Johnson's
 <a href="http://pj.freefaculty.org/R/Rtips.html">R tips</a>
 page is a organized collection of how to do things in R,
 with many questions and tips culled from R-help.

<li>A Google search of the web in general or
the r-project site specifically (put `site:r-project.org'
at the beginning of the search terms)
</ul>

<p><b>Responding to other posts:</b>

<ul>
  <li>In general, respond to the list, not just the poster.  This will
  result in your response being archived.
  <li>Rudeness and ad hominem comments are not acceptable.  Brevity is OK.
  <li>Take care when you quote other people's comments to respect their
   rights, e.g., as summarized <a
   href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/help/policy/copyright.htm">here</a>.
   In particular
      <ul>
	<li>The original authorship should always be clear,
	<li>Private messages should never be quoted without permission,
	<li>Enough context should be given to ensure that
        misrepresentation is avoided (even if your archived message
	is referenced at a much later date).
      </ul>
<li>When responding to a very simple question, use the following algorithm:
    <ol>
    <li> compose your response
    <li> type <code>4*runif(1)</code> at the R prompt, and wait this many hours
    <li> check for new posts to R-help; if no similar suggestion,
        post your response
    </ol>
    (This is partly in jest, but if you know immediately why
 it is suggested, you probably should use it!  Also, it's a
 nice idea to replace 4 by the number of years you have been
 using R or S-plus.)

</ul>

<b>Common posting mistakes:</b>

<ul>

<li>Missing or non-specific message subject

<li>Not doing basic homework before posting a question

<li>Not being more specific than `function xxx doesn't work'

<li>Being overly specific and not stating your real goal.

<li>Not including version and OS information in question regarding
  unexpected behavior.

<li>Finding a bug in an old version of R that has been fixed
  in the most recent version.

<li>Claiming that something is a bug when in fact the software
  is working as intended and documented, just not in the way
  you first expected.

<li>Claiming that some commonly used function is not behaving
  in a sensible manner (if you find the behavior odd, it's more
  productive and polite to ask why it behaves the way
  it does - after reading
  the relevant documentation.)

<li>Threatening not to use the software if you cannot get your question
  answered. Even when intended as a statement of fact, this tends to
  create negative attitudes.
</ul>


<b>Final words:</b>

<p>
It is a skill to ask good questions.  If at first you don't
get the answers that are useful to you, don't get
discouraged.  A response that is concise and technically
accurate may be just that, and not an intended putdown.  If
you feel insulted by some response to a post of yours, don't
make any hasty response in return - you're as likely as not
to regret it.  Read Eric Raymond's essay <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How
To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a> for more suggestions, and
for insight into people's behavior on technical mailing
lists (but don't try asking people at catb.org questions
about R).
</p>

<p>
Posters should be aware that the R lists are <em>public</em> discussion
lists and anything you post will be <strong>archived and accessible</strong> via several
websites for many years.
