      which has a <A HREF="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/">home
      page</A> (Oxford, UK)
      providing additional material, in particular `R Complements' which
      describe how to use the book with R.  These complements provide both
      descriptions of some of the differences between R and S, and the
      modifications needed to run the examples in the book.

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      (also with <a
      href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/Sprog/">home page</a>)
      provides an in-depth guide to writing software in the S language
      and is the first book to describe in detail some of the 
      differences between programming for S-PLUS and R. It treats R as
      one of three ``engines'' for the S language (S version 3, S
      version 4 and R).
