    The R Development Core Team would like to formally announce the
    creation of the

    <p align=center><strong>
    <a href="foundation/main.html" >R Foundation for
    Statistical Computing</a></strong>

    <p>
    There are many reasons for this decision on our part, largely it is
    based on the belief that R has become a mature and valuable tool and
    we would like to ensure its continued development and the development
    of future innovations in software for statistical and computational
    research.

    <p>
    The R Foundation is a not for profit foundation whose general goals
    are to provide support for the R project and other innovations in
    statistical computing. The R Foundation will provide a reference point
    for individuals, instititutions or commercial enterprises that want to
    support or interact with the R development community.

    <p>
    We would like to solicit memberships from interested parties
    (individual and institutional) in the R Foundation.  Details regarding
    fees and membership categories can be obtained from the web site and
    email enquiries can be sent to <a
    href="mailto:R-foundation@R-project.org">R-foundation@R-project.org</a>. 

    <p>
    Among the goals of the Foundation are the support of continued
    development of R, the exploration of new methodology, teaching and
    training of statistical computing and the organization of meetings and
    conferences with a statistical computing orientation. We hope to
    attract sufficient funding to make these goals realities.
