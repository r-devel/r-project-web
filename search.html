<h1>Search</h1>

For hardware reasons (disk space, CPU performance) there is currently
no search facility at the R master webserver itself. However, due to the
very active R user community (without which R would not be what it is
today) there are other possibilities to search in R web pages and mail
archives: 

<ul>
  <li>An <a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/search.html">R
      site search</a> is provided by Jonathan Baron at the University
      of Pennsylvania, United States. This engine lets you search help
      files, manuals, and mailing list archives.<p>
  <li><a href="http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/R/">Searchable mail
      archives</a>
      of the three mailing lists are provided by
      Robert King at the University of Newcastle, Australia.<p>
  <li> <a target="_top"
      href="http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.">Gmane's
      R-lists</a> mirrors several of our lists, with web, news, and
      RSS interfaces and search facilities.<p>
  <li><a href="http://www.rseek.org" target="_top">Rseek</a> is provided by Sasha
  Goodman at Stanford university. This engine lets you search several
  R-related sites and can easily be added to the toolbar of popular
  browsers.
</ul>


Thanks to all of them!

<p>
In addition, you can always use the advanced search feature of the <a
href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">Google search engine</a>: 
</p>

<form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search">
<table id="search" summary="google search">
  <tr>
    
    <td><a href="http://www.google.com"><img
      src="Google-Logo_40wht.png" border="0"
      alt="Google" align="middle" /></a> <input type="text" name="q"
      size="31" maxlength="255" value="" /> <input type="hidden"
      name="domains" value="r-project.org" /> <input type="hidden"
      name="sitesearch" value="r-project.org" /> <input type="submit"
      name="btnG" value="Google Search" /> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </form>
